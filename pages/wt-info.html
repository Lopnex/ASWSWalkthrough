<h3>General information:</h3>
<p>I know that it's tempting to use Save-Edits on the game.<br>
Be aware that <strong>changing game variables, switches or items might break the game</strong> as many of them are connected. This will also lead to the skipping of scenes and dialogue.<br>
I try to keep grind at a minimum as I hate this stuff as much as most of you do. So whenever you have to repeat an action I try to add in new dialogue or images so that there is always something new.<br>
Besides for those of you who don't like playing the actual game you can use the cheat book which lets you skip all the leveling up.</p>
<p>If you stumble into money problems look at the <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-tips">Tips &amp; tricks</span> section.</p>
<p>There is an option to increase the combat animation. See the options menu.</p>
<p>You can change your character name by visiting the baron.</p>
<h3>After the intro:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can regen energy/health by sleeping in the hay at the village</li>

	<li>You can open the Relationship overview with <strong>R</strong></li>
	<li>Items <strong>I</strong>, Powers <strong>P</strong>, Equip <strong>E</strong>, Quest Journal <strong>J</strong></li>
