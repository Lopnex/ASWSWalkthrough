<p>Farmer's daughter, southern Arenfield.</p>
<ol>
	<li>After the intro is complete talk to her while she's on the field and agree to help her.</li>
	<li>After the house tour is complete open the chest at the end of the floor, it contains the tools to work on the field.</li>
	<li>There is now a favor based system in place. Every action you take on the field gives you +1 favor with Penny. Sleeping in her house (-1) and having dinner with her (-4) reduces this favor.</li>
	<li>Work on the fields, plow, plant seeds and water the fields (You can refill your watering can at water trough near the fighters pit in the NE of Arenfield). Each action will take a lot of your Rest, if you're tired you can use the bed in Penny's house to regain it. There is no need to make all fields useable at once! Take your time and do this when ever there is energy left. By watering the fields you will easily gain enough favor with Penny.</li>
</ol>
<p class="cyan">Further details on the farming system:</p>
<ul class="cyan">
	<li>Each crop will also grow without being watered. Each watering will reduce the grow time by 1. So normaly it would take 20 days, if you water them every day it will take 10 days.</li>
	<li>Wheat can be grinded into flour inside Penny's house, she will then bake bread out of them. Selling one to Thomas and placing one for you on the table near your room.</li>
	<li>Other vegetables can be given to her when she's on the field. She will sell them every Monday and gain money by doing this.</li>
	<li>If you run out of seeds you can ask her for more during dinner. If she has no money left you can donate her some and she will buy seeds the next day.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
	<li>After you've planted the wheat seeds talk to Penny on the field. She will give you more seeds and advance the story.</li>
	<li>Have dinner with Penny (6pm) to gain her affection. If you work on the fields from time to time this should be no problem. Do this until she asks you to talk to her on the field.</li>
	<li>Talk to her on the field to trigger the next story event. If you already played through Tia's content up until the point where you were introduced to her mother Katherin you now have the option to ask her for help. Otherwise there is only Lucius. (If you choose Lucius this will enable optional future NTR content with him, if NTR is enabled).</li>
	<li>Have dinner with Penny. This will now trigger a 14 days timer at which end Henry will recover.</li>
	<li>Until Henry recovers you'll have time to corrupt Penny (see her corruption part) or you can just go somewhere else until the 14 days are over (there will be a notification when you enter the Arenfield map).</li>
	<li>Visit Penny's house to see a dialogue with Penny and Henry. If you did corrupt Penny up to anal she will afterwards have anal with you in the kitchen. If you didn't do that (not given her any cumwine) you get instead the option to kiss her.</li>
	<li>The next day talk to Henry near the field (at 9am).</li>
	<li>Have dinner with Penny at 6pm.</li>
	<li>If you've chosen Lucius to help Henry Penny will now talk about it. This will lead to her talking to Lucius about this on a monday morning. Lucius will then offer her a shady deal which she will accept. You can pay off her debt if you like. Otherwise (and only if Lucius has the MC's cum) he will start corrupting her (won't go over her maximum corruption value).</li>
	<li>The next day at noon Henry will visit Dave. You can sneak into the Mansion over the river as usual (see the <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-mansion">Mansion</span>).</li>
	<li>Walk up to Dave's room upstairs and interact with the star next to the room.</li>
	<li>After the conversation you can sneak behind the bookcase in the baron's room and listen to Dave and Giron talking about Henry. If you don't do it they will have their conversation during the coming day and you could miss it.</li>
	<li>Have dinner with Penny. (Maybe want to save before if you want to see both routes) During dinner you now have the option to tell Penny about what you've heard or stay silent. In case of NTR off mode this choice will be made for you.</li>
	<li>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Tell her: You will now kick Henry out. After that go to Penny's room. Depending on her corruption progress the scene will play out different with also different dialogue.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In the coming days you can further improve her affection for you by working on the field and having dinner with her. Raise her affection up to 25+ and then sit on the bed with her again. This will complete the quest.</li>
					<li>At all time you can also corrupt her to enable anal content. Her dialogue should always fit the situation. If there are problems please tell me and I'll fix that!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Stay silent: Henry will now ask Penny to sleep in his room. She will do so every 2 days now. If you did already hear the conversation between Dave &amp; Giron the next day if you have dinner with them Henry will tell That he's now starting to work at the mansion. (If you didn't have it you can either still listen in on the baron or wait until you get the notification on the village map) In both cases you will have to have dinner with them afterwards. This will complete the quest.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Now every 2 days Penny &amp; Henry will cuddle in the evening at 10pm, after the 5th time that happens they will have sex. This will also happen if you're not there. You can prevent it if you drug Henry's watercan with anesthetic from Lucius shop. This can be reversed should you change your mind.</li>
					<li>You can now continue to corrupt Penny, If she reaches 20 corruption and you have anal with her in her bedroom more than 5 times the MC will now ask her to have vaginal sex. If you've drugged Henry this can lead to being the first with her before Henry (Dialogue should adjust, please let me know if there are bugs!).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Sleeping in Fiona's (Penny's sister) bedroom does now trigger an event every 3 days when Penny goes to bed. To start this go to bed there before midnight and sleep until the next morning. Depending on if you had vaginal sex with Penny already she will come inside or just wish you a good night or ask you to join her in her room. If you had anal with her at least 3 times there is also an additional position available.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">During the day talk to Penny on the field, Abraham will come and greet you. (this might have happened a lot earlier depending on your playthrough) - The quest Rebuilding The Farm will start.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">After completing step 17 you can now talk about Abraham at dinner with Penny. Which will then lead to the Mc suggesting to rebuy Penny's land.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Talk to Penny on the field to visit the Coldstone estate with her.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Afterwards Talk about the events with her at dinner. This will now lead to two tasks.
		<ol>
			<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Build a Chickencoop south of the barn (required materieals have to be gathered, chicken can be caught with traps in the forest (Corven near the ruins in the forest will teach you how to build them if your hunting skill is high enough).</li>
			<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Revisit the Coldstone mansion and talk to Abraham (this can be done earlier, so if it's already done you can skip this step).</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Talk again to Penny at dinner, the next day visit Giron. He will offer you to rent the mill SE of Arenfield. Now you must clear the area of bandits and also enter the Mill and defeat them inside. When done talk to Penny again at dinner.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">In the morning talk to Penny on the field and visit Giron with her. You can buy some extra time for her if your reputation in Arenfield is high enough.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">From now on Penny will have to pay taxes every 30 days. Dave will come and visit her, and should she not be able to pay he will use the opportunity to make her do lewd things with him (later on also Henry) - You can prevent this by putting money into Penny's storebox in her room or by paying directly for her when Dave visits.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Visit Roderic (Carpenter's house) and task him to repair the Mill.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Clear rocks around the Mill (near the river) until the MC says it's enough.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Dig a channel and afterwards build a fence (this will require wood and nails).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">When everything is done talk to Penny at dinner.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Make sure all bandits are defeated near the mill - If you progressed Lyvia's story you can now also send your mercenaries to guard the mill.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Talk to Penny and inspect the area around the Mill. In the cellar you have to kill all rats and then interact with the candle at the norther wall.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">At dinner talk again to Penny. It is now also possible to go to the lake with her (can be done by talking to her at the field in the morning).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Next you have to repair the barn, to do that talk to Rick in the morning about Penny. If you have the required material you will begin the repairs directly and inspect the barn together with Penny afterwards.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Now it is time to find out about what you discovered earlier. For that visit the Coldstone estate around 12pm-4pm and knock on the door to see Elisabeth.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">At night you can either enter the estate by breaking in or by forfilling Elisabeth sex fantasies (talk to the 2 farmers on the estate map and bribe them for more info - then at 10pm interact with the highlight spot infront of the house).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Try the bathroom door that leads to Elisabeth's bedroom when nobody is around. The MC will notice how loud it is. You will have to grease it with either animal fat, slime shroom, soap, or lubricant.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">At midnight wait inside the bathroom until Abraham is near the bed, then enter the room from the bathroom side and interact with the indicated spot near the door.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Talk to Penny again at dinner. Should Henry still be with her this is your last chance to kick him out. Otherwise she will in the end marry him (not yet implemented) - Penny's quest to rebuild the farm is now completed.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">The next step is to get to know <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-lilly">Lilly</span>, this is something that can happen before this queststep and it is currently the end of Penny's story.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Corruption:</h3>
<ol start="40">
	<li>After completing Penny's story up until the point of Henry's return you can now offer her cumwine at dinner. (You need to complete Lucius quest to control your lust, Then you can use the craft menu (esc &#8594; Craft) to create cumwine, wine can be bought at the inn from Thomas at 5pm+) You can only do this if you have enough favor with her, so work on the field from time to time.</li>
	<li>After giving it to Penny wait until midnight outside of her room. When she reaches her room she will now start to masturbate. For the next step you must have learned how to use a lockpick (Bianca). Break open her door and watch her.</li>
	<li>The next day give her more cumwine at dinner, she will tell you about a vision. Now wait until night. When she's praying spy on her and walk in (this will advance the dialogue option the next day).</li>
	<li>Have dinner with Penny and give her cumwine for the third time. She will talk about the past day and her prayer.</li>
	<li>At night spy on her again while she's praying and walk in naked. If she has corruption 3 which should be the case if you followed this guide she will allow you to stay.</li>
	<li>The next day talk again to her at dinner (no need to give her more cumwine but you can do so if you have enough to further increase her C).</li>
	<li>At midnight when she's masturbating watch her again and enter her room.</li>
	<li>Do this again the next day. After that you either make her give you another blowjob or give her cumwine so that she's at 6+C.</li>
	<li>Walk in again while she's masturbating this will now trigger her next scene. If you have the lubricant from Tia's anal quest you can speed up the next part.. If not it will take a while for Penny to get used to... uhm it.</li>
	<li>After the 4th time you will also enable another animation for her.</li>
	<li>If her corruption is above 10 she will ask you to do stuff with her after the prayer. If you fucked her 5+ times you can have sex in there right next to Henry.</li>
	<li>If you did have anal sex with Penny at least 3 times and her corruption is &gt; 15 talk to her on the field. If you have neglected her for more than 3 days she will be desperate for a fuck.</li>
</ol>
<h3>NTR:</h3>
<ol start="52">
	<li>Should you have accepted Lucius help during Henry's arrival he will offer Penny a special medicine to reduce her stress (see 13.). Should you have allowed this to continue, walk in on a Monady when Penny is bringing her vegetables to Lucius. If Penny has C15+ she will tell Lucius that she feels differently. Lucius will then further examen her. You can spy on that from outside the shop if you look through the left window. After the first event his will happen every 2 days + monday. You can always watch them from outside.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Bonus scene Penny &amp; Natasha:</h3>
<p class="new-0-5-5-0">The scene is seperated into 2 parts.</p>
<ol>
	<li class="new-0-5-5-0">Penny confessing - Penny will gather sin points for actions that go against her teachings (having sex in any way) when she reached 5 sin points (Have anal/normal sex with her) - You will get a notification if Penny visits the church to confess (at 9am). - Now for the scene to happen you must visit her in the church while she is praying and Natasha must stand next to her. To then convince her to let you in she must have a corruption of 15+ AND you must have had sex on the field with her recently (before she confesses, this must be done only the first time, after that it is optional).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-5-0">For the second part of the scene you must have corrupted Natasha, So up to the point where you can have sex with her. Either with her normal character still intact or in her corrupted state, both versions work. If she has that state by the end of part1 of the scene AND Penny had 2 orgasms (only necessary the first time) then part 2 will trigger and you can visit her in the basement of the church.</li>
</ol>
