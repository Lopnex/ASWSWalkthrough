<ol>
	<li>Walk inside Emily's Hut and talk to Emily. She will put you on a task to get Wood and something she can cook.<br>
	To get wood you have to talk to Tia for cooking.<br>
	You can hunt at the lookout.<br>
	If you worked on the field for Penny give her vegetables (carrot/cabbage).</li>
	<li>Talk to Mira (make sure your lust is below 80) ask her what she's reading.</li>
	<li>Go to the shop and talk to Lucius. Talk about &#34;I was wondering&#34; - &#34; Say nothing&#34; to add Anesthetic to his shop list. Pick &#34;I was wondering&#34; again, &#34;tell him&#34; - &#34;What if...&#34; which will Add the quest Control your Lust.</li>
	<li>Pick the parchment from the shelf (50 copper).</li>

				<div>Walk to the lookout in the forest and pick up charcoal.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>You now need to talk to Mira after dinner which is only possible if you complete Emily's task. So either hunt for a rabbit (which will give you one Affection from Emily) or buy vegetables at the shop. For wood talk to Tia and buy or help her chop wood.</li>
	<li>Make sure lust &lt;80 (P). Talk to Mira and get reading 1. Do the same thing again to get reading 2.</li>
	<li>If you are at 7 Affection you can put your arm on her back while reading.</li>
	<li>Repeat at 8A hand on back and keep it calm.</li>
	<li>Repeat at 9A to unlock kissing her.</li>
	<li>At 10A repeat kissing 2 times. Emily will find out about the two of you. This will start the quest &#34;Learning the truth&#34;.</li>
	<li>You now need to get access to your old house. You can either pay for it (mayor's house) or if you've learned lockpicking through Bianca enter the house past midnight.</li>
	<li>Open the door to Marcus room (either strength or lockpicking).</li>
	<li>Read the letter on the desk, than search the room for a hidden path.</li>
	<li>There is a torch in the house near the fireplace (If you didn't already pick it up).</li>
	<li>Enter the hidden chamber and find the letter on the table. (The letter will be in your inventory after this and you can read it again anytime for some extra information).</li>
	<li>Walk to Emily's house, Mira will open the door and have a conversation with you.</li>
	<li>Visit Mira during the day in the church's basement. You now need to find a book for her in the Mayor's library, see the mansion, in the library you can find the book on the top left side of the room.</li>
	<li>At 4pm Mira will leave the church. Walk into the cellar and interact with her working table.</li>
	<li>The next day spy on her while she is working in the church (Star marked location).</li>
	<li>Repeat that on the next day.</li>
	<li>Talk to her at home during the evening. This will trigger the task to build an oven for her.</li>
	<li>Visit John in the smithy. You must have learned how to forge (see John) then he will give you a recipe to build an oven. For that you need 5 copper bars. One option to get copper is to buy the pickaxe from Lucius shop and mine the copper veins in the deep forest and near the ruins or you can kill enemies and hope for rusted swords that you can smelt at the forge.</li>
	<li>Build the oven at the anvil.</li>
	<li>Install the oven in Mira's room and put wood in it (you want to have 3+ wood in it at any time. If you lack wood the best way to get it is to run around the forest with Tia in group.</li>
	<li>Talk to Mira in the evening while there are 3+ wood in the oven and repeat this until Emily will make you climb out of the window.</li>
	<li>The next day wait until Emily went to her bedroom (10pm) then spy on Mira's door. There should be an option to walk in. If not cancel and make sure Emily really reached her endpoint then try again.</li>
	<li>You can repeat this scene with additional poses the next evening at 10pm in the same way. If you change position 3+ times Frisha will watch you. This will add dialogue for her scene when you fuck Frisha in Emilys room.</li>
	<li>You can now talk to Emily about Mira again, but she will tell you to leave her be for as long as she is an acolyte in the church.</li>
	<li>After you had sex with her at least once you can now visit her at her workplace inside the church for a new scene.</li>
	<li>From now on if you lose a fight and didn't have sex with Mira for 5 days she will wake you up in a different way.</li>
	<li>14 days after Mira joined the church her initiation ritual will start. During the ritual you won't be able to continue her love quest if you didn't finish it already. After the ritual you can continue it of course. The dialogue after the ritual will change depending on if you completed the quest already.</li>
	<li>Complete the ritual (See the <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-church">Church</span>).</li>
	<li>Talk to Mira on her bed and help her with her training until she likes to have the plug inside of her. This will result in a bj scene.</li>
	<li>Do that again and you also have sex with her.</li>
	<li>Enter her room after Emily went to bed, this will now enable the anal scene with Mira.</li>
	<li>In the afternoon if you already got up to the point that she has no problems with the holy symbol in her ass the scene has been expended by another animation (0.4.4.2) wait until Mira has an orgasm then change positions. If you completed Emily's quest up to the point where she has her new dress she will now find out that you have sex with Mira and confront you. (Now that Emily knows you don't have to wait until Emily is in her room should you visit Mira when dressing for bed).</li>
	<li>Depending on previous actions this will now open up the chance to talk to Emily again at her bed. If you didn't start a relationship with Emily you now have a chance to change your mind. Either way if Mira didn't know about the MC and Emily's actions the MC will afterwards have to tell Mira about it. If you fucked Syfa infront of Mira she will now be mad and start something with Aidalin. Unless you are in NTR off mode... Then nothing will happen and she will forgive you everything.</li>
	<li>The next time you fuck Mira in the afternoon and she has an orgasm Emily will show up again and start masturbating. Depending on her corruption (need 15+) you have the option to invite her in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mira's story continues in <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-monastery">The Monastery</span>.</p>
<h3>Corruption:</h3>
<p class="new-0-5-5-0">Should you have exchanged Mira's plug then you can corrupt her whenever you cum inside her mouth but also if you didn't do that it is possible now. In the evening at Emily's house you can now ask her to give you a BJ, since she doesn't wear the plug during this she can be corrupted there.</p>
<h3>Bonus scene Mira/Emily/Frisha:</h3>
<p class="new-0-5-3-0">You can now invite Mira/Frisha/Emily to have a bath in your new house. First you have to renovate it and also build the bathroom. Then have dinner with them in Emily's house (all 3 must be present). The MC will now visit the house and they have a bath. If you did everything up to this point in progress Mira will tell you to have a bath in private without the others. Visit Mira in the evening after dinner and invite her on a bath. You then have to sneak past Emily (if you get caught Emily &amp; Frisha will show up during the bath (Frisha must be at home that day and not with Dave and only if Emily knows about Mira &amp; MC having sex). If you built your bed you can have sex with Mira in your room afterwards and depending on if Emily saw her leave the house she will also stay the night at your house.</p>
<h3>Aidalin Route:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If you did option 3 or 4 during the church quest (after the sanctum) Mira will now visit Aidalin in his room every day at 7am. No matter if you watch or not this will happen. After 5 days they start kissing, After 10 days they'll have sex. MC can watch by interacting with the door to Aidalin's room in the cellar of the church.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-5-0">While in the monastery Aidalin will visit Mira's room at night to have sex with her. The MC can spy on them from the outside, should he masturbate and Heather's route have been played she will also come and take the MC to her room.</li>
