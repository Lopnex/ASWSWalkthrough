<p>Waitress at the inn. Daughter of <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-claire">Claire</span>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you stay the night at the inn (Claire quest or pay for your stay) you will see her talk to Thomas at 0am.</li>
	<li>During the evening (18-20:59h) talk to Rick in the tavern and ask him for a drink.</li>
	<li>Build up affection from Kate by giving her tips, and for winning fights against drunken soldiers.</li>
	<li>At 10A you can put your arm around her when she's sitting at your side of the table (depends on if you talk to the MC or to Rick) (If she's in a relationship with Rick you also need 2C to do this).</li>
	<li>Talk to her while she is dressing for bed and sit with her. Confess your affection and you will start a relationship with her.</li>
	<li>At 20A you can go to your room with her (If you rented it from Thomas, you have to pay your bill first to do this, with a Key you can always enter the inn even at night).</li>
	<li>At 20A you can tell Thomas to stop blackmailing Kate if you help her in the evening. (If you want to go into NTR with Kate read the NTR part below before doing this).</li>
	<li>At 20A you can tell Rick that you are in a relationship with Kate when the two are talking outside the inn at 12pm.</li>
	<li>After 7. talk to Kate in her bedroom to make your relationship with her official.</li>
	<li>If you got wine (or cumwine) with you (Buy from Thomas or steal from the cellar) you can offer it to Kate (during the evening talk in her room) and she will show you some of her moves. During this you can decide if you want to allow her to dance during her serving in the evening. If you allow it you can now move to the stage in the tavern during the serving minigame.</li>
	<li>During the afternoon watch her cleaning the tables in the tavern and touch her butt. Do this for 3 days.</li>
	<li>During the evening talk to Rick and start serving with Kate, some old friends will arrive.</li>
	<li>Talk to Kate before going to bed about her friends.</li>
	<li>The next day during the evening have a drink with her friends in the tavern.</li>
	<li>The same day (or if you miss it repeat the drink part) go to their door at the inn and listen to their conversation.</li>
	<li>Talk to Kate, she will ask you to bring her a new dress.</li>
	<li>Talk to Frisha and ask her about a dress for Kate.</li>
	<li>You can buy it from her or if you already had sex with Frisha 4 times she will give it to you for sex.</li>
	<li>Now you need to learn how to craft armor. Talk to Frisha and ask her to teach you. You need at least 1 point in Dexterity (Talent) if her affection for you is at 16+A you will get it for free.</li>
	<li>In your house (Marcus hut) you need to build a workbench. Get wood from Tia and nails from Lucius (shop) In the shop you can also buy cloth and yarn for the dress.</li>
	<li>If you didn't pay the Mayor to get your house key you can sneak into your house via lockpicking (<span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-bianca">Bianca</span>) past midnight and build the workbench at the blinking location.</li>
	<li>Interact with the workbench to craft the dress.</li>
	<li>Talk to Kate before going to bed. If you did Kate 11 you will now have sex with her (If you missed it don't worry you can repeat this anytime).</li>
	<li>If you talk to her again during the evening and choose to have normal sex you can now also switch to anal if you didn't poke her ass the same day already and had anal sex with her 3 times.</li>
	<li>After you had anal with her at least once you can convince her to do it in the tavern when she's cleaning the tables.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Choose if you want Kate to wear the dress in the tavern (NTR) or only in her bedroom, you can change this choice afterwards by talking to her in the evening. From here on there are 2 routes:</p>
		<strong>Love route:</strong>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>In the evening sit at the table and drink with Toren and the others, choose to not buy them another round.</li>
				<li>During the day between 8-20h go to Tia's mothers house (cliffs) and talk to her about Kate, she will give you herbs to drug the 3 guys.</li>
				<li>Talk to Kate in the evening, if she wears the red dress tell her you want to talk.. The MC will give her the herbs.</li>
				<li>The next evening sit with the guys again. After the first round order drugged beer.</li>
				<li>Walk into the Darkwood north of the Hunting ground you will find the Ruins. There is a house that is intact. Before entering prepare yourself for a fight (Level 6 enemies) You might want Tia with you as support. Although with Level 10 and fitting gear you should be able to do this without her.</li>
				<li>Either lose or win the fight. If you Lose they will escape and you will see them again in the future, if you win they are dead.</li>
				<li>Wake up Kate, depending on Tia being in group she will thank you or both of you.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<strong>NTR route:</strong>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>With the red dress on start a serving minigame.</li>
				<li>Take a seat with Toren and co.</li>
				<li>After work talk to Kate in her room about Toren and decide that Kate should go over there.</li>
				<li>Follow her and watch. If her C > 15 she will give them a blowjob.</li>
				<li>After she's returned to her room talk to her again and talk about Toren again, tell her to continue (If she didn't give them a blowjob yet you have to do this again to trigger the extra dialogue).</li>
				<li>The next day when Kate is at their room again watch them again.</li>
				<li>Talk to Kate in her room about Toren, this will complete the quest.</li>
				<li>You can now choose Kate to not wear her red dress in the tavern, this will also deny her to visit Toren and the others in the evening.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>Talk to Kate before going to bed, Claire will join and you plan how to travel to Kirlic.</li>
	<li>After this dialogue it is possible to trigger the threesome with Claire and Kate. To get this Claire must have C5+. In Kates before bed dialogue choose to stay in her room, don't let her dance and convince her to have sex (she must either be drunk or C10+) Claire will watch and afterwards the scene continues. Can be repeated and If you don't fuck Claire for 2 days she will show up next to Kate when going to bed.</li>
	<li>In the morning talk to Rick at the bridge he will ask you to get a blueprint and to ask Penny for renting her barn.</li>
	<li>Talk to Penny when she's working on the field (SW of Arenfield). She either wants 5 gold (will give her 1A) or if you don't want to pay that much, 1 gold.</li>
	<li>Now Find Grant at the main square. (He is in Arenfield on Monday and Tuesday) Ask him for a blueprint.</li>
	<li>On a Mon/Tue evening play cards with Grant in the tavern and win in Blackjack until he is out of money (choose 1gold bet and if you have problems quit after each game and save after each win). When He lost all his money he will offer to give you his donkey in return for his money. Accept the offer, then go outside and interact with it.</li>
	<li>Ophelia is in town every Thursday and Friday. Talk to her about buying her horse. Now that you got a donkey to trade for the horse she is willing to give it to you for an extra 10 gold. If you don't want to pay that you can trick her by buying an anesthetic+vegetables at the shop and then interacting with the horse. Then talk to Ophelia again. If you trick her this will have consequences in the future.</li>
	<li>Grant will return a week later. Talk to him about the blueprint. He wants an astronomical 30 gold for it. You can either pay that or instead steal it from his room at the inn when he's sleeping. To do this you must have learned how to lockpick and completed Mira's quest up until learning to read and your intelligence must be at 4+. With the parchment and the coal you make a copy of the blueprint.</li>
	<li>Talk to Rick in the morning. Now that everything is prepared you will list everything you need to build the wagon (you can read the blueprint to see this anytime). Start building the wagon with him and continue every day until it's done.</li>
	<li>Talk to Kate in the evening before going to bed. This completes the quest.</li>
	<li>You can talk to Kate when she's meeting Rick at noon before the inn to repeat the scene in the barn. If you already had anal with her you can change positions.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">For the next step of the quest to Kirlic you must first progress <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-ophilia">Ophilia's</span> story up to the point where she starts working at the inn.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">Talk to Kate at night when she is going to bed, she will ask you about travelling to Kirlic and you can now agree to do that.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">On the way to the Old Boar inn a scene with Kate will play if Claire already joined you and Kate at night.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">At the Old Boar inn you can enter Kate &amp; Claire's bedroom at night for a threesome (only if Claire joined Kate before).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">Now you must convince Bjorn to smuggle you into Kirlic. There are 3 ways to do that:
		<ul>
			<li>Convince him by winning against him in gambling 2 times (you have to win all his money in the afternoon) - the first time you take everything he will offer you to spy on him and his wife having sex (only on ntr on mode). After the 2nd time the MC will explain why he wants to go to Kirlic and Bjorn will agree to help.</li>
			<li>Share Claire with Bjorn (more about that at Claire's story).</li>
			<li>Help Carmen with her quest and choose that you want her to convince Bjorn.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">After you've completed that queststep talk to Claire and Kate during dinner at the Old boar inn.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">This is for now everything you can do, Kirlic needs to be implemented before this quest can be completed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Events:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>If Kate has 30+ Affection during december (ingame month or realtime), visit her in her room when she's going to bed. After seeing this scene you can replay it by giving her something to drink at night and choose Winterhowl during the dance options.</li>
	<li>If you allowed her to dance in the Tavern the dance becomes available during december.</li>
	<li>If you have too many drinks with Rick during the serving game (3+) he will stumble and crash to the ground afterwards. Help him to his bed together with Kate. If you already had sex with Kate and Arianna you can now visit Arianna's bedroom and start a threesome relationship with them. You will have to repeat the process. After the 2nd Time there is a 50% chance that Rick will get drunk on his own (just wait until 10pm inside the inn).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">If you continue the event with Arianna &amp; Kate Rick will eventually wake up. You now have the option to invite him in, if you decide against it he won't show up again (This is for those who don't want to share). If you allowed him once he will show up again, you can then choose to ignore him or let him join.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">At the old Boar inn: In the afternoon you can have sex with Kate in her room.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">At the old Boar inn: After completing Carmen's quest you can trigger a scene with Kate by sleeping in your bed over noon (if you are in bed at 12pm Kate will come and wake you up). At 4pm you can talk to Kate inside her room to have sex <span class="new-0-6-0-0">(if anal progression is done there is also an animation for that).</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Pregnancy:</h3>
<ol start="45">
	<li>After you came inside Kate at least once and your affection with her rises up to 30+ she will talk to you about contraception when going to bed. You now have the choice to take care of contraception yourself (buy it at Lucius store) or let her take care of it (This decision can be changed afterwards during the sitting on bed dialogue). If you choose to take care of it yourself this will allow you (by not taking it) to impregnate Kate.<br>
	Should she be involved in any other sexual activity with Thomas or others she will also have an inner monologue if she should use contraception when having sex with others than the MC.<br>
	Higher lust increases the chance that she will get pregnant.</li>
	<li>After you got the notification that she got fertilized she will talk to you about it when going to bed. After that it will take another week before her belly grows. You will get a notification about it and should you interact with her outside the inn or when going to bed she will tell you.</li>
	<li>After that it will take 20 days until the child is born. You can have some fun with Kate when going to bed and should she had something going with Thomas before the pregnancy this will continue.</li>
	<li>After you got notified that Kate has born a child you have 7days to talk to her. Should you not do that she will give the child away and you will lose 5 affection with her.</li>
	<li>If you interact with her you will have a choice depending on if you already built the orphanage for Emily. If you did that and also asked Roderic to build beds for it (at least 1 free bed) you can decide to keep the baby. This will only be possible for the two children with Kate. Any further child will be given away. So decide well which you want to keep.</li>
	<li>If you decide to let father Francis take care of the child Kate will be upset (only if you don't have 2 children at Emily's orphanage already) and you will lose 5 affection with her.</li>
	<li>Kate will nurse the child for another week, then you will get a notification that she has either brought the child to Emily or given it to Francis.</li>
	<li>The next time you go to bed with her she will talk about the pregnancy again.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Corruption:</h3>
<ol start="53">
	<li>You can raise her corruption by mixing your drink with love potion or if you sold them to Lucius some of the soldiers might use them on her.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-0">At 5C she will give you a BJ in the MC's bedroom at the inn (after you had sex with her at least once).</li>
	<li>At 10 corruption she will give you a hand-job in the tavern if you try to make her drink love potion again.</li>
	<li>If you had sex with her a few times in your room you can convince her (if she is at 10C and you at least at 3C) to have sex in her sleeping room.</li>
	<li>Giving her cumwine in the evening after you told Thomas he should leave her alone.</li>
	<li>If she gives you a blowjob during the scene with Claire.</li>
	<li>After she's gone to bed (must happen before 6am) remove her blanket. Depending on her corruption/affection she will invite you into her bed (must have had sex with her at least once). At 25 corruption this will trigger another scene.</li>
</ol>
<h3>NTR:</h3>
<ol start="60">
	<li>You can talk to Rick and approve his attempts on Kate (If you do this before you start a relationship with Kate it will lead to Rick giving her tips during the serving game) When Kate's affection for him reaches 5 talk to them in the morning outside the inn. They will declare they're now in a relationship. From now on they will meet in Kate's room every 2 days to have sex. You can watch from outside the room (might need to wait a moment) AFTERWARDS if you now want to start a relationship with Kate too you must corrupt her first up to C2. Do that during the serving game (must have completed Lucius quest). Kate will be conflicted and you can either choose to keep it a secret from Rick or tell him. If you tell him you can later allow him again to have sex with her after building the wagon.</li>
	<li>Fail her serving task and listen to her talking to Thomas without helping her.</li>
	<li>You can fail the serving game by talking to Thomas and telling him that you don't want to work.</li>
	<li>If you did 7. and Thomas already had sex with Kate before she will sleep with him again if you don't fuck her for 3 days.</li>
	<li>After telling Thomas that he should leave Kate alone you can now talk to him during the evening at the bar. He will offer you a deal to stay at the inn for free if he is allowed to punish Kate again.</li>
	<li>There are now 3 different punish scenes that will trigger if you fail the serving minigame with Kate. The scenes will also trigger with different dialogue if the conversation with Thomas happened and Kate has C10+ and you don't have sex with her for 3 days.</li>
	<li>After watching Thomas fucking Kate watch them a 2nd time this will open the option to select that you like watching them (this choice will also change the reaction the MC has towards other NTR events). If you selected yes this will now open a new dialogue option with Kate if her corruption is at 20+ (Stay in room, Talk about Thomas) when you sit with her on her bed (going to bed event). Afterwards Kate will be more open with the MC. This will also enable a new scene with the soldiers during the serving game (encounter happening at random).</li>
	<li>If you lose more than 1 gold to Grant during the Blackjack minigame he will ask you for a private chat with Kate (You must have a relationship with her). She will then visit him at midnight. Talk to her afterwards in her room. Do this 3 times and there will be a scene with them.</li>
	<li>If the scene between Kate and Grant happened she can now trigger a new scene by talking to him during the serving game.</li>
	<li>If you completed the prepare for Kirlic quest you can now invite Rick on a threesome. For this: You need to tell Rick about your relationship with Kate, she must have had anal with you and her corruption is at 20+ First talk to Rick about Kate (in the morning or at the bar) Then talk to Kate when she's meeting Rick at the inn (9am) when the option shows up give Rick a sign.</li>
	<li>After you had sex with Rick &amp; Kate in the barn 5 times he will ask you to have fun with her alone. If you agree he can now build up to 5 affection for Kate during the serving game. At this point they will meet inside Kate's room every 2 days. Dialogue will change depending on if they had a relationship in the past and the MC broke them up.</li>
