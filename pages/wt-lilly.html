<p>Maid at the Coldstone Estate</p>
<ol>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Interaction with her is possible after you visited the Coldstone estate and got to know her (During Penny's quest).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Break into the mansion without disguise and talk to her while she is working. You will introduce yourself as the new guard.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">She will soon be skeptical if more guards are even necessary. To proof that to her disguise by using the bandit disguise (which you got from Emily's quest) and then interact with her to scare her into calling the guards.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Without a disguise talk to her again, she will now agree that more guards are needed and you can now also interact with her at night when she is in her room (knock on the door when she is inside).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">You can also spy on her at night by interacting with the door.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">To make things easier you can put the guards to sleep by using sleep-wine in their quarters (it will last until you get caught by guards in any way).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Visit Lilly at night and during the day to increase her affection further. At some point she will ask for a massage. If her Affection reaches 6 visit her again at night.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-9-1">You now have the choice to keep up the game you play with her or stop things to then later on help her to regain her memories. (This is also as far as you need to go to complete Penny's quest &#34;The lost sister&#34;).
		<ul>
			<li class="new-0-5-9-1">Regaining her memories is currently not possible and will come in a later update. So if you choose this there won't be any more content at the moment - I can already say that this will lead to some changed dialog, but not necessarily a better outcome (so it doesn't mean this is the only love route), and any NTR content which might be added isn't affected by this choice.</li>
			<li class="new-0-5-9-1">If you agree to be her boyfriend you can do more sexual interactions with her in her room. Make also sure to increase her affection by either interacting with her during the day or at night. At night when her affection is at 15+ you can then do the final interaction that will currently be the end of her progression.</li>
