<p>Priestess at the church.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Talk to her during the day when she's near the statue in the church and talk about your curse.</li>
	<li>You must have 70+ alignment to continue and have Lucius quest &#34;control your Lust&#34; completed, inspect the fountain in the church past midnight before 6am (hide in the cellar/use a lockpick).</li>
	<li>Hide in the basement until 8pm then walk upstairs and taint the fountain.</li>
	<li>The next morning watch Natasha drink water from the fountain.</li>
	<li>Now you need to lockpick the door to the sleeping quarter (<span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-bianca">Bianca</span>) in the basement.</li>
	<li>The next day you have to repeat these actions and watch her drink and then when she's in her room from 4pm-20pm spy on her from her door. You can talk to her about her being a priestess during the day (while she's near the statues) to see how her attitude changes.</li>
	<li>At some point she will start to masturbate and after watching her you can enter her room.</li>
	<li>At this point you now also have the choice to stop her breast grow. To do that buy a strong anesthetic at the shop and pour it into the fountain after midnight. This way if Natasha's breast haven't grown to max size she will stay true to her goddess. If Natasha ever goes to max you can still reduce and then expand her breast-size afterwards. But once at maximum her behavior will change forever.</li>
	<li>You can also talk to father Francis during the changes to get his reaction to Natashas changing condition.</li>
</ol>
<h3>NTR:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When in her room choose some of the options that do not involve having sex with her. Then once available choose that she should visit the pater. After that watch at his door. From now on if the player didn't interact with her that day she will visit the pater at 8pm. There are 2 different animations that play at random when spying on them.</li>
