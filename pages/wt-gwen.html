<p>Witch in the cottage. <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-sabrina">Sabrina's</span> master.</p>
<ol>
	<li>After completing the intro talk to her inside her cottage and have sex with her (4 times) until her corruption is at 20 (You can see her current corruption in the relationship menu) She will now lose corruption every day. If she reaches 0 she will return to her old form. To progress her quest you always must help her to stay in her new form.</li>
	<li>You now have to learn how to read (see <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-mira">Mira</span>).</li>
	<li>Talk to her again and ask her to become her apprentice, this will start the quest &#34;An Unholy Hunt&#34;.</li>

				<div>Enter the swamp and walk around it until the MC tells you that you have to search inside the cave.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>Now you have to fight and win against a plague fiend (Level 15+) bring Tia with you if you're having problems.</li>
	<li>Back inside the hut you will have a conversation with Gwen. If you were lucky and the plague fiend dropped a heart the quest is completed. If not wait for 3 days and then enter the swamp again, new plague fiends can spawn every 3 days. Kill them until you get the heart. Then talk to Gwen at the cauldron (she must be in her new form).</li>
	<li>Now you have to wait 4 days until Sabrina recovers. Enter the room through the door to trigger the scene.</li>
	<li>Now you can enter Gwen's bedroom and have sex with her when she's sleeping (uncover her).</li>
	<li>
		<p>Talk to Sabrina to begin the training. You can only do this once every day and it will lead to 3 puzzles that you have to complete, If you get stuck just leave the room or use the book in your inventory (key item):</p>

						<div>To start the 3rd puzzle you must first increase your witchcraft skill to 2 (talent point).</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>After completing the puzzles talk to Gwen when she's at the cauldron (again she has to be young) and talk about allying with her.</li>
	<li>As the next step you will now have to make a decision, either you decide to become Gwen's champion or disobey her which will lead to an alternative route with her sister Athia. (if you decide against Gwen you will still be able to have sex with her, but you won't get more powerful and she will still treat you like her pet) - The following steps are all skipped should you decide to disobey her. You can however still see the new scenes by talking to her at night at her bed (change position) and during the day at the cauldron.</li>
	<li>Should you ally with her she will ask you to bring her some materials for the ritual. You can get straw from the hay stacks on the Farmland map to the east of Arenfield. Wood has to be gathered in the forest, cloth can be bought at the shop.</li>
	<li>After that return to Gwen, she will have a private talk with you in her room. Afterwards you will witness the ritual.</li>
	<li>Return to Gwen and talk again about allying with her. She will now bond with you. From now on if you use any of her magic you will increase her corruption. You will also learn a new spell. Should Gwen reach 100 corruption you will gain a buff which further increases your magic damage/defense and will also make you immune to poison/bleed. If her corruption drops below 5 she will drain energy from you to restore some of it.</li>
