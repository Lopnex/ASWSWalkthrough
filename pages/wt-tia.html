<p>Woodcutter north of Arenfield. Daughter to <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-katherin">Katherin</span>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Talk to her (lust &lt; 80) to chop wood, repeat (if Affection &lt; 2 she will need another round of chopping).<br>
	After your strength increase from chopping trees you now know how to do this. There is an axe near the old ruins on a stump. With it you are now able to cut trees in the forest.</li>
	<li>Affection 3+: Talk to her about the topics. Beginning Interests to top. On &#34;how she gets by&#34; Disagree with her. After talking about Origin you need to talk to Rick about Tia and tell him to get more information. (Talk to him Early morning at the bridge or at the inn during the evening)</li>
	<li>Affection 7+: Chop 2 times more and you can choose to kiss her she will ask you then to visit her at home.</li>
	<li>Visit the house of her mother (Katherin) to the west of Arenfield between 16:00-20:00.</li>
	<li>Now talk to Tia in the house and take her to the way left of the house, down into the forest. From there go East to the bridge and then north up the river.</li>
	<li>In the deep forest you can reach Rumah village in the NW.</li>
	<li>After you arrive in the corner Raaisha will attack you. If your INT talent is above 3 you can talk yourself out of that fight.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Now in Rumah village you have to get your reputation up to 5:</p>
		<p class="new-0-5-1-9">NTR: if you leave Tia in Rumah and then don't come back for a week she will start getting angry at you. She will first start wearing tribal wear and then after a while start a relationship with Dasan. You can prevent this by completing the reputation quest and then to mend your relationship sleep in your hut with Tia.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Talk to Raaisha again (make sure you have enough health) and win against her in a 1on1.</li>
			<li>Talk to Raaisha after you won against her, she will send you to rescue 2 of her hunters.<br>
			1. Is to the East near the orc camp.<br>
			2. Is to the south both in the deep forest.</li>
			<li>Talk to the blond haired guy near the palisade, he wants meat from rabbits and deers. You can either hunt them or buy them at the inn from Thomas.</li>
			<li>Talk to the guy below the chieftains hut, he's the lumberjack of the village and asks you for 20 wood logs. With Tia in the group you can cut down some of the trees in the forest. Every 3 days also new trees will spawn.</li>
			<li>Talk to Hiba (woman in the middle of the village near the water bowl) and give her a bottle of wine (buy from Thomas at the inn).</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Talk to the chieftain again and choose reputation. (Tia has to be in group and her A for you at 15+, if below sleep with her in your hut for a few days).</li>
	<li>You can talk to Katherin after the events, Tia will now give you the key to Katherin's house.</li>
	<li>From now on you can have dinner (8pm) with Katherin and Tia and inform Katherin about the situation in Rumah.</li>
	<li>If you sleep with Tia in her bed at Katherin's house during the morning when Katherin isn't home Tia will want to have sex.</li>
	<li>Tia can now stay in Rumah Village if you walk to the star near your hut. By talking to her you can make her dress as a proper wanita while in the village (this will be expanded in the future).</li>
	<li>If Tia's has c11+ and is in her tribal wear near your hut you can now fuck her at the fire.</li>
	<li>Talk to Dasan. This will update the quest log to search for his father's body. Dialogue with Raaisha will also update after every major event.</li>
	<li>To start the anal with Tia you must have had sex with Hiba and you must raise Tia's C to 11+. Then have sex with her in your hut. The next time you sleep in your hut with her she will give you the option to talk about anal.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Now there are two options, option 2 will be used in this to continue &#34;Fate of the Rumah&#34;.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Just continue training with her every day until she is prepared for sex.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Visit her mother to get a book about potions (can also be done after the quest is completed).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can now fetch water in Arenfield at the barrel next to the fighting pit for the other recipes.</li>
					<li>For the lubricant you need shrooms that you can find in the well next to the orc camp.</li>
					<li>Buy a rope at Lucius shop, then use it by clicking on the left side of the well in the deep forest. Inside the well you will find the shrooms (They regrow every 3 days).</li>
					<li>You will also find Ibhar's body. If you have at least perception 1 inspect his body again until you notice that he's holding something in his hand.</li>
					<li>Use the craft menu (press 'C') to create the lubricant.</li>
					<li>The next time you have anal with Tia use it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>You now have 4 (2 if non NTR) options to continue:</p>
		<p>Talk to the guard next to the entrance of Rumah (save the game before doing this)</p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>When the option pops up show the Piece you found in Ibhar's hand. Dasan will run away (Nyra will be shocked but happy that you didn't kill her son, potential love route).</li>
			<li>Don't show the Piece you found in Ibhar's hand and fight him. If you defeat him then he's dead (Nyra won't forgive you if you kill him, but in the future there will be a corruption route, this will disable the love route).</li>
			<li>NTR: you can lose the fight if Tia is currently present in Rumah (was in your group or is standing there) to save you she will take the punishment after that you must talk to Dasan again (Tia will now when ever you leave her at Rumah have sex with hunters at 6pm and with Dasan at 9pm (Nyra will be condescending but you will get the option to have a route with her to dethrone Dasan at a later point).</li>
			<li>NTR: instead of talking to the guard you can make a deal with him (Nyra same as c.).</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Now you have to scout the orc camp. To do that walk up the path near the waterfall where you've rescued the hunter before and walk towards the river (must have Tia in group).<br>
	<strong>If you did (a/b) you should be prepared, this means: Have the best possible equipment, be completely rested/feeded, you should be level 8+ and buy 5 ropes from Lucius shop (he restocks them every monday)</strong>.</li>
	<li>Back at Rumah you now have to choose (depending on your previous path) if (c/d) one of the girls will leave with the orcs. If (a/b) you can choose to fight them instead.</li>
	<li>
		<p>The next steps differ depending on if you are on Dasan's route or if you've become the chieftain:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dasan: Follow the quest log and talk to Dasan until he tells you that you can just go to the orcs and challenge Gurtak. For that one of the women has to be there at the time. Challenge and win against him. This will bring Maui to show herself. Now you can make a deal with Gurtak. Back at Rumah the quest is completed. You can now also fuck Raaisha if you talk to her in the morning before she has sex with Dasan. Orcs will no longer attack but if you talk to Dasan you can send one of the women to them.</li>
			<li>You can now challenge Gurtak to a duel in his camp and afterwards make a deal with him or use witchcraft on him (in case you completed Gwen's story to that point).</li>
			<li>
				<p>Chieftain:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>If Dasan ran away during the confrontation you can find him again to the south of Madrag Kaz and challenge him at his tent. (NTR: Should either Lyvia or Tia be in group and you lose the fight he will take one of them afterwards. If both are in group it is random)</li>
					<li>Umin will talk to you after the battle and you should go see him (right under the chieftains hut). Rumah villagers will now collect resources every day. You can boost their morale by putting wine bottles on the bench near the palisade or (NTR) you can talk to him (workerstatus) and he will ask you if you want the women to entertain the men (can be changed back afterwards by talking to him again about this). If motivated the workers will gather more resources. Wine will be consumed over time.</li>
					<li>You can now enter the chieftains hut and talk to Raaisha/Tia if they are in Rumah and you can collect the gathered resources there, Raaisha will ask if you could help the wounded. Talk to one of the men sitting under the fire, he will ask for healing tincture for him and the other wounded (can buy it at Katherin's house) after that talk to Raaisha in the hut again and she will give you a handjob.</li>
					<li>Gather resources and talk to Umin about building defenses. To get copper bars you must have completed John's quest you can then smelt the copper ore in his smithy into bars. Ropes and nails can be bought at Lucius store.</li>
					<li>Build the towers first. The gate is optional and will only give towers more time to shoot at the orcs.</li>
					<li>After the first battle you can Talk to Raaisha again in the chieftains hut.</li>
					<li>Now you have to fight the orcs 2 times. If people get wounded, talk to them near the fire again. On the second attack you might have to run from the orcs coming at you and lure them near the towers so they get shot.</li>
					<li>Now walk into the orc camp and fight Gurtak. After you won you can either kill him or make a deal with him or use witchcraft on him (in case you completed Gwen's story to that point) to end the attacks on Rumah.</li>
					<li>Back in Rumah you can now talk to Raaisha again and she will become your wanita. If her corruption is higher than 4 (blowjobs) she's also willing to have sex outside of the hut. In both paths you can visit Katherin after the events of the first battle. Bring Tia with you and she will teach both of you the nature talent which allows you to detect plants in the forest. You can mix them into healing tincture if you did Tia's anal quest or just sell them. It would make sense to raise this talent only with Tia as the MC already has some other talents to keep in check.</li>

It would make sense to raise this talent only with Tia as the MC already has some other talents to keep in check</p>
	</li>
	<li>After you fought with Gurtak and either witched/killed/made a deal and you've completed went to celebrate in Rumah, visit Katherin.</li>
	<li>Have dinner with her (might need to do this more than once depending on if you did have dinner with her before) until you tell her that Rumah is now saved.</li>
	<li>The next day have dinner again and she will ask you to hunt for her.</li>
	<li>The MC now has the idea to impress Katherin and cook for her and Tia (will start a quest).</li>
	<li>Depending on your Progress with Emily or Claire you can now learn to cook from both of them. For Emily you need at least 8 affection and a rabbit meat + woodlog. For Claire you must have agreed to work at the inn. If she has 5A she will do it for free, otherwise you need to pay her 2 gold. (If you completed Claire's story before up to after the scene in the cellar she won't let you go without cleaning her up).</li>
	<li>You can learn both Recipes even if you talked with one of them first.</li>
	<li>Now you need to cook 3 dishes (of the same kind) of either Emily's or Claire's special dish (buy salt at the shop, get vegetables from Penny) cook at any cooking station (Inn, Emily's house, Mayor's house....).</li>
	<li>Interact with the cookingpot icon at the table in Katherin's house and serve a meal.</li>
	<li>Have dinner with Katherin &amp; Tia. The next day go to the hunting ground and win or lose (NTR) the fight.</li>
	<li>Now Tia is determined to fight the orcs. It also opens up Options to go for her Mother now! See Katherin.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">If you progressed the Rumah story up to the point that Umah is about to attack it (or past that) you can tell Tia about her father during dinner with Katherin. This will give you the choice to either agree with Katherin or Tia, it will be easier if you agree with Tia.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">The next day one of them went out to visit the mountain. If you chose to go with Katherin you have to sneak through Madrag Kaz from the east and leave through the west gate without being seen (stealth is useful here), if you chose Tia you can leave the forest map before Madrag Kaz through the NW, there you get to a small cliff where Katherin has put a rope for you.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">Enter Calan's Rest and get near the fortress so that the next queststep is started.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">Visit the smithy in Arenfield and talk to John. He will give you a recipe to craft climbing hooks. Use the anvil to craft them, you need 1 for each party member (make 3).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">If you witched Gurtak before you can now talk to him and send him to Calan's rest. He will then make the fight easier and open up the option to let him take control after you have dealt with Tia's father.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">You can now fasttravel to Calan's rest by using the map, go there with enough energy to climb up the mountain. You can either fight your way through or if done right sneak up until the final room.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">Hidden items in the fortress: on top of the tower outside you can find an orc armor piece, this will lead to some new recipes the MC can craft at the crafting bench, search all weapon rags and crates inside Zorads camp to find resources and a trollbone dagger for the MC.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">Now you can fight with Zorad to defeat him and then determine his fate (if Gurtak is there he will help you, but be careful: If you lose the fight Gurtak will die).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0"><span class="red">There are now variations you can go with: If you lose a fight to the orcs outside they will bring you before Zorad which will lead to Tia being more and more convinced that the MC is incapeable of dealing with her father. If you lose too often and Tia's corruption is at 20+ she will tell the MC that she has changed her mind and decide to become Bolgan's moglia. Alternativly if you defeated Zorad you can choose to make Tia Bolgan's moglia if she came in contact with him before.</span> Other options are to let Gurtak take over, bewitch Bolgan or leave the seat empty.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">Back at home you can now cheer up Tia by having a bottle of wine during dinner. This will end the quest.</li>
</ol>
<h3>New scene:</h3>
<p class="new-0-5-3-0">For the scene with Katherin &amp; Tia a few things must happen first: You must charm Katherin and have sex with her 5times. Then sleep at in Tia's bed with Tia and have sex with Tia in the middle of the night (Tia must be corrupted (20+) to do that). Change position until Katherin wakes up. She will masturbate and Tia will notice it. Do that again another night. Now have dinner again with Katherin &amp; Tia, give them wine and at the fire afterwards kiss Tia. This can then be repeated, the next time Tia will realize that the MC is having an affair with Katherin. Which then changes some dialogue and will have consequences for the future.</p>
<h3>Corruption:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>If you completed the &#34;control your lust&#34; quest from Lucius you can spice her water (which she will ask you to bring her at 7+A) go to the Water barrel next to the fighting pit. Afterwards use your Masturbation skill.</li>
	<li>At 2+ corruption she Is OK with you touching her in the open (100 lust talk to) (As an alternative you can just make her become your wanita and then increase her corruption with blowjobs in your hut).</li>
	<li>At 5 corruption you can grope her breasts and she is willing to give you a blowjob in Arenfield, You will also be able to undress her further when cutting down trees which will then result in new scenes if you allow her to take off her pants too.</li>
	<li>With Tia in group and her corruption above 5 use your masturbate skill to increase her corruption.</li>
	<li>There are several dialogue changes depending on how high her corruption is in Rumah Village. If you get her corruption above 11 you will see them all but it might interest you how she reacts if below 11.</li>
	<li>At 20 corruption you can have sex with her in Arenfield if you touch her with high lust value in the morning.</li>
	<li>Also at 20C she will wake you in the middle of the night when you sleep with her in her bed at Katherin's house.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">If you neglect Tia for a few days (no sex) and then sleep in your hut and tell her you're tired she will take things into her own hands in the middle of the night.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">At your camp: You can interact with Tia if she is there with you. Her tent is at the bottom left. Depending on progress with her she will react differently.</li>
</ol>
<h3>NTR:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Watch her cut wood once per day, lose to the charging orc while Tia is at 4+ corruption.</li>
	<li>To revert: Every time you win against the orc this will reduce Tia's interest in them.</li>
	<li>When in the Hunting ground and the orc scouts attack lose to one of them with Tia in group (Feign death potion from Katherin).</li>
	<li>Lose to the Orc brutes with Tia in group (Warning this will result in the losing of her virginity. If you want this for the MC try to not lose until after the reputation event in Rumah Village) - If Lyvia is in group she will also have sex with another orc.</li>
	<li>If you make Tia available for every man in Rumah (Either Dasan or Chieftain) she will have sex with one of the natives in the evening near the fire New: If you had anal sex with her 3 times you can now join in.</li>
	<li>If you lose to a brigand (enemy in Lyvia's story) with Tia in group you will either see a scene with Lyvia or Tia. (if only one of them is in group it will 100% be a scene with the person in group).</li>
	<li>If you take Tia / Lyvia with you into the mine and lose a fight against the goblins it will trigger a scene with one or both of them depending on who you've in your group.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">After you lost a fight at Calan's rest and Katherin isn't held hostage Zorad will taunt the MC to send her to him. You can then talk to Katherin in her hut to send her there, this will free Tia (wait for her in Katherin's house).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">If you chose either to not kill Zorad (lost to often) or made Tia Bolgan's moglia you can visit the Zorad's throne room again and she will have sex with Bolgan. (She will then return home the next night). If Zorad is alive there is a 50/50 chance Katherin shows up to join in. If Lyvia is in group and she had sex with orcs 10 times she will join in by fucking the other guard. (To reclaim Lyvia leave the map, she is now in another room where you can kill the orc she has sex with).</li>
</ol>
