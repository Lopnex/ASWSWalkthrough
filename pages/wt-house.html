	<li>After you have renovated <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-emily">Emily's</span> house visit yours. The MC will now think about renovating his own house.</li>
	<li>You will need some materials for that (see quest description) after you have gathered those and have rested you can start the work on your house in the morning.</li>
	<li>After the ground is renovated you have to also build the 1st floor in the same way.</li>
	<li>Talk to Roderic, he will offer you furniture for the house.</li>
	<li>Most important is the bathtub. To build it you must craft an oven at the smithy and you then need 5 iron bars (these are available if you already ventured into the mine, see John).</li>
	<li>For the kitchen you need a cauldron which also can be crafted at the forge in the smithy.</li>
	<li>Talk to Lucius about candles, from now on you are able to gather animal fat from killed animals, you can sell it for a good price to Lucius, after selling him 10 he will offer you candles in his shop (you have to wait 1 day).</li>
	<li>If you bought 20 of them enter your house to light everything up.</li>
	<li>If you interacted with the cat outside your door and build up affection on her this will open up the option to build a cat-door for it. Talk to Roderic about it.</li>
