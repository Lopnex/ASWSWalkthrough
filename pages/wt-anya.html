<p>At the Southern edge of Arenfield.</p>
<p class="new-0-5-0-0">Her content is available right after the intro, however you will need around level 35+ to complete her quest (and fitting equipment).</p>
<ol>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Talk to her outside her house, she will ask you to leave her be and enter the house.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Come back the next day in the morning (around 9am) and enter her house (door should be open).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">You are now tasked to reclaim her stolen goods. For that ventures south to the cliffs. Enemies there are 35+ so be careful and bring Tia/Lyvia with you.<br>
	(NTR: if you lose a fight against the rogues with them in group they will have sex with the Rogues).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">There is a valley to the southeast which you can't enter. You need a rope from Lucius store to get there (use the tree at the edge to tie the rope to it).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Down in the valley you now have to kill all Rogues at the camp. If you completed Bianca's content you can sneak up on them to make it easier. After killing the first Rogue you have 5 ingame days to clear the camp. If you can't do that the camp will respawn.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Loot the chests at the camp and return to Anya.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Give her as much as you like from the money (if you give everything you will gain affection). She will also reward you. You can now ask her to give you a massage if you pay her at least 1 gold. You can now also enter her house, but be careful to not enter her bedroom when she's getting ready for bed (that would cost you all affection).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">The next day wait until 6pm and talk to her while she sits at the table in her house (you will need at least 4 affection).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">The next morning talk to her outside the house and start to clean up the house by interacting with broken stuff and furniture.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">The next morning talk to her outside her house and ask for a dinner. She will agree, bring some wine (cumwine also works) from the tavern.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-0-0">The dinner takes place at 6pm. Afterwards you will have to make a decision which will have impact on future events.</li>
	<li>
		<p class="new-0-5-0-0">There are now 2 options:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p class="new-0-5-0-0">Join Van's rebellion.</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Hekima will free you and you and Anya return home. She will show you the basement and by talking to her she will return upstairs. You can now have dinner with her and she will give you a free massage once a day.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Wait until 8pm, Hekima will come to Anya's basement, talk to him. You now have to progress <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-penny">Penny's</span> story up to the point where Henry returns from the front with a message.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Talk to Hekima and he will give you a fake report which you have to bring to Giron. (Visit the Mansion during the day).</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Report back to Hekima, he will now instruct Anya to reward you. Have dinner with her and she will take you to her bedroom.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Now you have to progress <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-john">John's</span> quest and complete the order for King Eric. While on the village map the MC will make a remark on it. You can now talk to Hekima about it.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Hekima wants to use this opportunity. Make sure you're rested and well equipped, as you will have to do a fight (losing isn't an option).</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Afterwards you will have to make another decision (wether you want to share Anya with Hekima or have her for yourself).</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Walk upstairs, you can now also choose if you just want to have fun with Anya or start a Relationship. After having sex with her the first time you will unlock another animation with her.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">NTR: Should you have allowed Hekima to go after Anya: He will do that every evening at 8pm. This will gain him one affection point from Anya but only if her corruption is 5+ - if she is on love route talk to her after 5 days, she will ask you if you're ok with her doing stuff with Hekima (she needs C15+ for that), this is your last chance to stop things - If you are on fun route (and she has C10+) she will just continue with Hekima and eventually go to her bedroom with him at 10pm &#8594; They will now kiss inside Anya's bedroom, wait until they kiss naked then spy at the door. Should you not have taken Anya's virginity then Hekima will now.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">A new quest will have started after 8. to go to the frontline to get Anya's mother Haying, but this quest isn't implemented yet!</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="new-0-5-0-0">Stay out of it (you may be able to join any side later).</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Anya will free you and you will have to fight the guard. (if you lose it's game over).</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Outside you can choose to run and jump over the fence or fight your way out.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Return to Anya's house, she will explain the situation to you.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Anya won't leave the house now. The next step is to find a guard for her house. Depending on your progress with Lyvia you will now have to talk to her OR if you already have your mercenaries in town talk to the lazy merc who sits near the inn and tell him to guard Anya's house.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Now you will have to clear the Hideout again, this time fighting Hekima's men. Kill them all then enter the house at the outpost and leave a message for Hekima.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">Return to Anya and talk to her in the basement. She wants you to spend another evening with her. Prepare before visiting her. Then bring wine and talk to her in the evening.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">The next day you will duel with Hekima. The fight isn't too tough, however should you lose he will take Anya with him. (in the current version you won't be able to free her, so you might want to load. It will be added in Anya's next update).</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">After the fight you can choose to spare of kill Hekima. You will be returned home to Anya where you will spend the night with her. Giving you the choice to start a love relationship or just doing it with her for fun.</li>
					<li class="new-0-5-0-0">A new quest will start, but this isn't available right now.</li>
