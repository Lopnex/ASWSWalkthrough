<p>Blacksmith. Father to <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-melissa">Melissa</span>.</p>

	<li>Talk to him and he will sharpen your dagger for 20 silver.</li>
	<li>Ask him if he would teach you how to work in the smithy.</li>
	<li>Bring him a rusted swords (Drop from orcs and bandits).</li>
	<li>Use the furnace to smelt 3 rusted swords into copper bars.</li>
	<li>Talk to John again, now you can use the smithy to craft a bronze dagger.</li>
	<li>After creating a silver weapon (see Arianna's quest) John will teach you how to make armor plates from copper which can be used to upgrade your armor pieces.</li>
	<li>After the events around Dave and the Baron (Frisha's quest) the king will ask John to make his delivery.</li>
	<li>Talk to John inside the smithy about it. You now have to bring him 1 iron ore from the mine south of Arenfield. Enter the mine and use the Pickaxe from Lucius shop to mine iron (It will respawn every 5 days).</li>
	<li>Talk to John again. While he's happy it won't be enough to do this alone. The next step is to convince the Baron to operate the mine again.</li>
	<li>To do that you must have completed Lyvia's quest up to the point where you have the Bandit camp formed into your base.</li>
	<li>After you've send men to guard Arenfield talk to the Baron again. He will want proof that you can deal with the goblins, so <span class="red">you need 5 goblin ears</span> in your inventory.</li>
	<li>Now that he's satisfied and you have still 5 men stationed in Arenfield the next step can happen.</li>
	<li>Visit your camp and send 5 other men (not the ones that are in Arenfield) to the mine (if necessary you have to recruit them first).</li>
	<li>After that is done you can visit John to give him the good news. The next day the miners will start working inside the mine. They send 3 iron ore per day to John's smithy. He will make first bars out of them and then if he has enough bars swords. You can help him by using the furnace or anvil. Everytime a sword is forged John will trust you a bit more.</li>
	<li>After 20 swords are forged talk to John again and visit the Mayor.</li>
	<li>This completes the quest.</li>
</ol>
<p class="yellow">The part where John helps you to arm your men will be part of Lyvia's next update!</p>
