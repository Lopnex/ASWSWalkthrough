<p>Mother to <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-mira">Mira</span> and <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-frisha">Frisha</span>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>You can raise A with her by giving her rabbit meat (hunting: see <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-corven">Corven</span> or buy them at the inn during the evening).</li>
	<li>After getting to 5+A and if 7 days after completing the intro have passed, sleep at her place.</li>
	<li>Two bandits will attack, if you manage to kill both (attacking early) the quest won't start and you will only be tasked to find the camp.</li>
	<li>
		<p>If Emily got captured you now have 7 days to either pay the ransom at the old oak or rescue her.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Rescue her:</strong>
				<div>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<div class="inset">
								<div>
									<img src="/ASWSWalkthrough/images/emily1.jpg">
									<div>Walk into the Dark Wood and follow the foot-prints into the deep forest. Inspect the prints near the river, afterwards inspect the tree.</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>Back to Arenfield and talk to Tia.</li>
						<li>On the other side go inside the shed and interrogate the bandit.</li>
						<li>Now you have to search the forest for 3 runes, the locations are random so look around the other maps (entrance, hunting ground, bridge, hidden path, deep forest).</li>
						<li>Under the bed in the shed you can find a chest with gold There is a shortcut to the Old oak on this map.</li>
					</ol>
					<img src="/ASWSWalkthrough/images/emily2.jpg">
					<ol start="6">
						<li>After your Keystone is charged go back into the deep forest and inspect the foot-prints at the NW edge of the map.</li>
						<li>At the bandit camp you can now try to sneak towards the cave to rescue Emily, if the guards detect you the camp will be alarmed which will make it much harder to reach the cave (wait until the next day to set it back to normal). During the night (20h-6h) it is much easier because the guards aren't patrolling as much as during the day.</li>
						<li>At the cave you have to kill the bandit (hard without a better armor or weapon, see John and Lucius) and get the keys from his body. Afterwards escape the camp without being detected.</li>
						<li>Should you lose the battle you will lose your keystone, in the forest near the entrance of the camp will spawn a new bandit where you can get a new stone.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Pay ransom:</strong><br>
				To get more gold you can talk to Mira every day she will give you 20 silver. Place the gold under the old oak before the time is up.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>After you paid the ransom/rescued Emily you can now sleep at her place without bringing her food (She will give you a key to her house). Bringing her rabbit meat will still increase her A towards you.<br>
	<span class="yellow">(7 days after the rescue: if you sleep at the storage room the bandits will attack again).</span></li>
	<li>At 11+A visit her room in the evening when she is dressing for bed.</li>
	<li>Continue sleeping in her bed until she starts playing with you while you sleep.</li>
	<li>Run into her before she enters her bedroom in the evening (try to peek on Mira).</li>
	<li>Continue sleeping with her. At some point she will ask you what this is the two of you two are doing. Choose if you want a relationship or just fun. If you already completed Mira's ritual in the sanctum the relationship option for Emily isn't available. On the other hand, If you do Emily's route before Mira and choose to have a relationship with her she will later tell Mira about this and you start a dual relationship/Harem.</li>
	<li>After 9. if you already kissed Mira and Emily caught you she will ask you what this is you are doing with her daughter. If you tell Emily that you would leave her if things between Mira and you work out she will end the relationship (If you started it), but you can still have fun with her.</li>
	<li>If you don't have sex with her for 1 day and just sleep in her bed she will wake you again in the middle of the night.</li>
	<li>To continue Emily's story you must progress Mira's story up to the point where she joins the church.</li>
	<li>Now go to bed with Emily, she will ask you to come with her to talk to Giron the next day.</li>
	<li>The next morning talk to her when she's in the kitchen and visit Giron.</li>
	<li>
		<p>During the conversation you have 3 options to continue:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pay Emily's taxes (This will give you 30 days).</li>
			<li>If you have positive reputation in Arenfield this also gives you 30 days without having to pay.</li>
			<li>Let Emily handle the situation (possible NTR path).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>From now on you can visit the Mayor to also pay Emily's taxes. You will see their current state in the questlog. A quick info about the NTR path:<br>
	If you don't pay her taxes you can witness her talk to Giron if you enter the Mansion over the river entry and then sneak to Giron's study or use the bookcase.<br>
	Each time Emily visits Giron things will get worse. She visits him depending on the info in the questlog at 9am in the morning. If you wait in his room it will be 10am.<br>
	After this happened more than 3 times she will permanently have to visit him even if you complete the quest. If you have NTR disabled this won't happen of course ;) - <span class="new-0-5-4-0">There is a pregnant variation of this scene</span>.</li>
	<li>Talk to Emily in her bed again when going to sleep.</li>
	<li>Have dinner with the family.</li>
	<li>Talk to father Frances in the church.</li>
	<li>Talk to Rick in the morning at the bridge.</li>
	<li>Talk to Emily then gather material.</li>
	<li>You will need a lot of wood, nails (shop), 2 robes (shop), 10 clay (perception search near water (river, lake, swamp) ) 20 stones. You will be able to mine stone after you build the scaffolding with Rick.</li>
	<li>Talk to Rick to start building, repeat until he can't continue.</li>
	<li>Now you will have to talk to Emily before you can build the final part.</li>
	<li>To continue use the spark indicator near the scaffolding.</li>
	<li>If you didn't already, clean the storage room in Emily's house. You can now build stairs in that room.</li>
	<li>Get to the second floor and talk to Emily.</li>
	<li>Now visit father Francis in the church and talk to him about Emily.</li>
	<li>Leave the church, this will complete the quest!</li>
	<li>Talk to Emily when going to bed.</li>
	<li>To build furniture for the 2nd floor visit the carpenter's workshop (Roderic) and talk to him when he works there. You can now buy beds for the orphanage.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-4-0">If you renovated the MC's house (upgraded his bed) you can invite Emily to sleep with you. To do this talk to her in the evening when she is cleaning up after dinner. If the MC wants sex don't let yourself be distracted. Once you have invited her you can trigger this event also at the MC's bed in his house.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pregnancy:</h3>
<ol start="33">
	<li class="new-0-5-4-0">If you came inside Emily after the renovations in her house are done she will have a talk about it before going to bed. You can now choose to enable pregnancy for her or she will take care of preventing it. (If you choose her taking care of things she will ask for money from time to time).<br>
	If enabled cumming inside her can get her pregnant now (higher chance the higher your lust is). This will then start a quest which will also reveal the relationship to Frisha &amp; Mira (shouldn't they know already). - The decision on how to handle pregnancy can be changed again if you go to bed with her and choose to cuddle &amp; Talk.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-4-0">
		<p>During pregnancy there are 2 scenes with Emily:</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>In her bedroom when going to bed.</li>
				<li>In the kitchen: if Emily has an orgasm in the kitchen (wait for it) and you then close the options menu once (choose any action aside cum) depending on people inside the house a different scene will play out.<br>
				NTR: In case Frisha is talking to Dave (they must have had sex once) and you ignore them and go directly into the kitchen, they will join in. Emily will need 15C+ for this to be an option.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Marriage:</h3>
<ol start="35">
	<li class="new-0-5-4-0">If you chose a relationship with Emily earlier then you have the option to marry her. You can start the related quest by cuddeling with her.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-4-0">There are a few steps on this quest, follow the questlog it will guide you through. The place you need to find for the proposal is near Katherin's house. When getting the suit from Verena there is a scene with her should you have progressed with her up to the point where she has sex with you. Otherwise you will have to pay her for the suit. The scene there is repeatable and can also be started should you gotten the suit earlier by paying.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-4-0">After the preparations are done you can trigger the wedding on a Sunday. The scene at the end of it is repeatable, choose the option to have Emily wear the dress again when going to bed with her.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-4-0">The wedding will cause reactions from other women in Arenfield should they have been present. This is something that I will further improve in the future, which will also bring this up when starting relationships with other women. This is a time consuming task, in some parts it is already implemented in others it's not. Frisha's dialogue when visiting Emily at night is updated for example, some of her other scenes aren't.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Corruption:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Each time you cum in her mouth raises it, more and more altering her behavior.</li>
	<li>At 10C and if you didn't fuck her for 3 days she will fuck you in the kitchen after you brought her food (small scene).</li>
	<li>If you didn't fuck her for 5 days and sleep in the storage till late evening she will come to fuck you (small scene).</li>
	<li>If Emily has 15C+ and you completed the housebuilding talk to her in the kitchen while your lust is above 50.</li>
	<li>If you had.. Uhm missing spoiler tag.. more than 6 times anal sex with her she will also be willing to fuck you right in the kitchen.</li>
</ol>
<h3>NTR:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Fail her rescue quest.</li>
	<li>Fail to often and Emily has sex with the bandit (small scene).</li>
	<li>After 2nd: Lose to the bandit guarding her. If Imawyn also is at 10C the scene is extended (small scene).</li>
</ol>
