	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">To unlock her content play <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-kate">Kate's</span> story up to the point where you travel to Kirlic.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">In the morning talk to her downstairs, ask her about her son afterwards.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">She will send you back to Arenfield to ask guards inside the Drunken Fox inn for him. In the evning interact with the guard in the tavern at the south east table (left side of it).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">He will tell you to check Bjorn's old bed in the barracks. Go there (next to the Mayor's mansion) and check the last bed on the right side.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">Return to Carmen and talk about her son and what you found. She will then want to do a séance with you to find out where he is. You can ask for something in return (touching that will lead into the guilt path of her) or you can ask her to complete Kate's queststep to convince Bjorn or do it for free. (last two steps are for the love route)</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">The next day you can talk to her again to begin the séance.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">After you wake up the next day talk to her again (make sure that you're well rested and at least level 30)</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">After the scene you can now work at the old Boar inn by asking Carmen about work you can do so in the back of the garden (you first have to check the shed to get seeds).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">Working will increase Carmen's affection and you can also put wheat/hops in the crates near the field so that Bjorn brews beer of it which he will then sell on the market (You gain half the income from Carmen).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">At 10 Affection or if you have gone the guilt route up to the point where the MC thinks about asking Carmen to clean his room (on the guilt route the mc must masturbate in his room by using his skill).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">In the morning enter your room when Carmen is cleaning. After that all scenes with her are available when asking for a favor.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">You can also ask her to clean your room and when then staying in bed she will wake you up with a blowjob.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">Other interaction in her bedroom is possible when Bjorn is asleep.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-8-0">You can impregnate her, but there are currently no scenes for that. (Her belly won't grow).</li>
