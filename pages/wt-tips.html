<h3>Talent checks</h3>
<p>Talent checks are explained in more detail in the ingame tutorial.<br>
Go to Inventory &gt; Key items &gt; Tutorial gem</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p> If you keep food above 70 you get a regeneration effect which lets you heal faster.<br>
If it drops to 0 you will get a debuff in combat.</p>
<h3>Rest</h3>
<p>If it drops low you will get a debuff in combat</p>
<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>Once you paid John to upgrade your dagger make sure to switch to it in combat using the arrow keys (&#8592; &#8594;).<br>
Use Quickshot when you got 20 TP.<br>
If in a harder battle try to keep the block buff from Defensive Strike up.</p>
<p>If you want to lose a combat situation on purpose Talk to <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-katherin">Katherin</span> and she will give you a Feign death potion</p>
<h3>Crafting</h3>
<p>There are items that indicate that they can be used for crafting.<br>
The crafting menu can be opened with <strong>C</strong> or via the menu.<br>
You will learn more recipes over time and some need a special location like the smithy or workbench to be built.</p>
<p class="new-0-5-7-0">When crafting armor or weapons you will increase your skill level. Depending on that you will unlock upgrade slots on your newly crafted gear.</p>
<h3>Hunting</h3>
<p>To increase your chances of succeeding in the hunting check increase your skill and try to get to the target without being seen.<br>
If you are spotted wait a moment then try again otherwise your chances are decreased.<br>
At a skill 3+ of hunting you will never miss a shot on an unaware rabbit and at 5+ you won't miss on a deer.</p>
