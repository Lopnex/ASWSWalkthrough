<p>Complete <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-mira">Mira's</span> story up to the part where she joins the church.</p>
<p>Warning, this quest is meant for level 25+ But it can be done at any level of course!</p>
<ol>
	<li>14 days after Mira becomes an acolyte the father wants her to undergo a ritual to become a priestess.</li>
	<li>Visit the church during the day (between 7am-4pm).</li>
	<li>Optional: If you already completed Mira's love quest you can now visit her in the afternoon and start her training with the holy symbol.</li>
	<li>3 days later Aidalin will arrive in Arenfield. Visit the church between 7am-4pm.</li>
	<li>Wait for two more days until you get a notification. Now talk to the father about Mira.</li>
	<li>To further progress you need the torch from the MC's house. You can enter by lockpicking the door at night or by renting it from Giron.</li>
	<li>You also need the lockpick skill that Bianca will teach you to open the cellar door.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Inside the sanctum head SW until you find a closed door. Now you must bring a sacrifice for each god.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Uldar - Remains of an evil creature (anything from a Plaguefiend or Demonkey from Syfa).</li>
			<li>Gromthul - Any flesh from an animal.</li>
			<li>Athia - A parchment, buy at Lucius shop.</li>
			<li>Dwarven statue - copper ore.</li>
			<li>Alaira - Any herb or plant (can buy them from Katherin).</li>
			<li>Isha - a vial of cum or cumwine (see Lucius quest).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>After leaving the door Syfa will show up. She will hunt you while you're in the sanctum. If you want to reduce contact with her to a minimum don't interact with her after you defeated her. That will give you another 60 seconds (120 total) before she reappears.</li>
	<li>After you lighted all the torches at the gods statues interact with the door. Inside the sanctum walk up to Mira. Now if you have NTR content enabled you get offered a choice. You can either believe Mira or don't. The later will result in a sex scene but will also bring Mira 1 step closer to seeing your relationship only as a sexual thing.</li>
	<li>Back in the church if you didn't believe Mira she will now ask you why you did it. If you tell her that it was a mistake and you love her she's fine. If you tell her you're not sure about the relationship it will open up the Dating with Aidalin route for her.</li>
	<li>Back home you can't change the outcome, but it will depend on your previous choices. Mainly if you did Emily's story and decided to tell Emily that you want a relationship with her. If you did that, she will now tell Mira. If you told Emily it is all just for fun she will keep quiet. If you told Mira you're unsure about the relationship she will leave the table and not speak about it at all.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Talk to Mira when she's sitting on her bed. There are now 5 different scenarios:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You completed Mira's love quest before, didn't fuck Syfa infront of her, Didn't tell Emily you want a relationship - Everything is fine, You'll have fun with her.</li>
			<li>Didn't complete Mira's love quest, didn't fuck Syfa infront of her, Didn't tell Emily you want a relationship - Everything is fine, you can now do the love quest with changed dialogue bits.</li>
			<li>Broke up with Mira - She will be heartbroken, Tell her you didn't mean it and everything is back to normal.. Or wait for a few days, she will now start dating Aidalin. If you tell her you want her back after they kissed she will tell you that she's no longer sure if she wants you back and will keep the thing with Aidalin going.</li>
			<li>Told Emily you want a relationship and fucked Syfa infront of Mira - She will tell you that her believe in you is shaken and she will be ok with it but also now seek out other men (Relationship with Aidalin open).</li>
			<li>Told Emily you want a relationship, Didn't fuck Syfa infront - Mira will accept that you're in a relationship with her and her mother.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Option 4 and 5 will result in possible threesome scenes in the future. I will add other coming out options for Emily later on but currently only this will lead to Mira knowing about Emily and also mentioning this during her love quest if you didn't complete it already.</li>
	<li>The father will now write a letter, but future steps of this quest aren't implemented yet. See Mira for additional info about anal and the Aidalin route.</li>
