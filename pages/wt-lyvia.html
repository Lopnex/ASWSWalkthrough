<p>Captain of the militia.</p>
<ol>
	<li>1. After <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-imawyn">Imawyn</span> got captured talk to her in the afternoon near the training field.</li>
	<li>Visit the barracks (Right door at the Mayor's mansion) and sit with Lyvia during the evening, repeat the next day.</li>
	<li>Talk to Lyvia near the trainingsfield and agree to take care of Imawyn.</li>
	<li>Visit Imawyn in her cell. If her corruption is &gt; 10 she will now offer to have sex with you.</li>
	<li>Wait until the next morning and visit the barracks again.</li>
	<li>Now find out what happened at the bandit camp (If you don't want to lose the next fight you should be around level 20+ and well prepared. You can lose the fight, however if you don't want to see an NTR scene with Tia you shouldn't bring her with you (only in NTR on mode)).</li>
	<li>(Optional) Frank, one of the soldiers can be saved if you have a healing potion with you. Examine the soldiers until you find him.</li>
	<li>If you have Tia with you and did complete her story in Rumah up to the point where she's your wanita sleeping in the tent will trigger another scene with her.</li>
	<li>After you returned to Arenfield visit the barracks again in the evening and talk to Lyvia. Repeat on the next day. Now you can recruit her when she's near the trainingfield during the day. She will join you when you leave the village.</li>
	<li>From now on Brigands will spawn in the forest (there will be more interaction with them next update) If you lose to them with Tia or Lyvia in group it will trigger an NTR scene (if enabled).</li>
	<li>Visit the banditcamp and talk to Lyvia near the fire. You can now name your mercenary group. If you pick Lyvia's suggestion she will react to it, But that's up to you ;).</li>
	<li>You can also visit her in her room at the barracks, only do that after you rescued her or it will result in a day at the pillory.</li>
	<li>Talk to her again inside the camp when she's sitting at the fire.</li>
	<li>The next step is to recruit 5 mercenaries. To do that fight brigands that are now spawning inside the forest and on the field to the east of Arenfield.</li>
	<li>After defeating one of them talk to the defeated brigand and try to recruit him. You can either pay them gold or win a talent check on intelligence (normal or with witchcraft).</li>
	<li>After you recruited 5 mercenaries visit Giron in Arenfield (The mansion), enter the house over the front door. Inside talk about business with Giron.</li>
	<li>Visit the camp and enter the leaders tent. Inside there is a star marker on the right side. Interact with it to open the map. Now click on the flag near Arenfield and send over 5 mercenaries. If you rescued Frank he will already be stationed there and you will only need to send 4. Leave the map by clicking the X on the top right corner.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">This completes the quest and as long as there are 5 mercs in Arenfield you won't have to pay for your house.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">Visit the camp again, Lyvia (if she is there) will talk to you about expanding the camp.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">Talk to Imawyn near the fire (you must get her out of prison first if you didn't do that already and improve the relationship with her).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">Check the area to the southeast of the camp near the star. You need an axe in your inventory and the MC must have slept.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">In the new area clear all trees, you can then build a training field.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">Talk to Lyvia again, after that you can go into the leaders tent and assign mercs to the trainingfield (you must recall them first if none are at the camp). You can also assign Lyvia to train with the mercs to speed up the process.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">By going outside again the MC will think about starting a party to improve the morale. If you done Liandra's quest and sent her to the camp then this quest is already completed. Otherwise the steps are the same. Check <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-liandra">Liandra's</span> camp route to learn where to find everything.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">Morale at camp will only rise when the mercs get payed or when you start a party and at least 1 mercenary is at the camp to participate. Depending on how much you allow him to participate morale will rise further. (if you let Tia dance naked or expose Lyvia's butt for example).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">If you assign Lyvia to the trainingfield you can ask her to train with you. This way you can learn to wield a sword with the MC. You have to do some training with her first though. In the future you will also be able to learn skills this way (currently not implemented).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">Next step is to build a tent to increase the number of mercs that you can have. Do that near the training field.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">Now visit John at the smithy and talk about equipment for your mercenaries. If you already helped him with his delivery he will work for you.</li>
</ol>
<p class="new-0-5-1-9">You must have completed <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-liandra">Liandra's</span> content up to the point where she is either at the camp, in that case you must have had the conversation with Giron about it and spied on him from the bookshelf or has her new dress at the mansion.</p>
<ol start="29">
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">By going back outside there will be a guard near the inn aksing you to visit Giron. <span class="red">(Warning, this will progress the story and will temporarily disable some content. Only do that if you have enough mercs already and are at least level 30+).</span></li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">Giron will ask you to secure the traderoute. You can do that at the camp by interacting with the map in the leaders tent. You can only send rank 2 or rank 3 mercs to guard the road. (there is a small risk of them dying there).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">After you have guarded the road for up to 7 days the quest will further progress. Visit Arenfield again during the daytime. There will again be a guard near the inn calling you to come.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">After visiting Giron a timer of 30 days will start. You might want to prepare before you do that!</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">Return to camp and talk to Lyvia. Now go inside your tent and interact with the map. There is a new location. Recall your men to camp and send as many as you like into the forest to scout.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">Now you are able to head out there yourself and help them with their search. Every day the progress will increase if there are men in the forest, also your men will kill brigands in the forest, each time you search there is a chance of finding one of the dead brigands which will increase the progress. There are also random ambushes which also increase the progress.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">When the progress reaches 100% you will find the camp if you head out there.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">Back at camp prepare for a duel with the Raven and send your men (at least 5, but 10 is better) to prepare the attack. Then you can start it inside your tent.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">At the camp you can climb up the stone close to the entrance to use a sideroute into the camp.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">Go south and confront the Raven at his tent. You can either win or lose the fight. If you lose the Raven will always escape, if you win you have a chance to set him captive.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">Back at Giron's mansion you will get your reward. If you brought Yasmine back in time he will continue the marriage with her. If you didn't he will look for someone new (not implemented yet). If you captured the Raven he will insist on you marrying Julia. If not then only if you brought Liandra to him he will accept you to marry Julia. If you didn't bring Liandra or the Raven you will just get gold.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">Return to camp and talk to Lyvia, this will conclude the quest.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Love &amp; Corruption:</h3>
<ol start="41">
	<li>Lyvia's love/corruption route: After you started to recruit mercenaries you can start a relationship with Lyvia. To do that you have to increase her affection to 10. You can do that by visiting her inside the barracks at night before she goes to bed or by sitting with her at the campfire. By giving her wine you will increase this by another 1. If Tia is with you she will also benefit from that. If you give her cumwine at the fire this will increase her corruption. You only need to do it twice then there are other options to further increase her corruption.</li>
	<li>At 10 affection make sure you're alone with Lyvia at the fire (If Tia is also there talk to her and send her to chop some wood).</li>
	<li>Now Lyvia will start to tell you more about herself. Afterwards you can take her hand to get some more reaction from her.</li>
	<li>After you done that 3 times the MC will kiss her. This now opens the option to visit her at her tent.</li>
	<li>After she went to her tent go there and she will ask you to come inside.</li>
	<li>If you have sex with her this opens up the option to have sex with her inside her room at the guard barracks, she will also give you the key to her room if you sit with her at the table in the barracks.</li>
	<li>If you started to corrupt her she will now also offer to give you a blowjob. This way her corruption will increase further which changes part of her dialogue. At 10C she will also have no problems when Tia gives you a blowjob (jerk off).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">After you had sex with Lyvia 3 times you can finger her ass in the reverse ride position. If her corruption is at 10+ she will be fine with it. Do it 3 times and she will be ready for anal.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">After you had anal with her at least 2 times you will be able to switch to another anal position in her tent.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">During the party you can expose Lyvia's ass. If she is at 10C+ she will be fine with it. If Tia is arround she will notice it and depending on her corruption either be thrilled or pissed. You can have a conversation with her afterwards. She now knows about You and Lyvia and this will lead to new content in the future.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">After the party ended you can fuck Lyvia near the fire if her C is high enough. If her anal training has progressed and you allowed the mercs to participate you can invite in the watching merc for a threesome.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-9">Otherwise if you visit Lyvia's tent after the party she will be waiting for you in her white dress.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sharing:</h3>
<ol start="53">
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">If you allowed the merc to join you (step 42) you can talk to Lyvia near the training field and tell her to entertain the men (requires 20C and needs at least 2 mercs at the camp). From now on she will do that every afternoon while she is ordered to train at the camp.</li>
</ol>
<h3>NTR:</h3>
<ol start="54">
	<li>If you lose to the brigands there is a random chance they either ask Tia/Lyvia for pleasure favors. If you only have one of them in group this limits the options ofc. After Lyvia gave 2 blowjobs the brigands will ask for more.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">If you lose to brigands on the mission to find the Raven there is a scene with various dialogue for Tia / Lyvia.</li>
	<li>If you take Tia / Lyvia with you into the mine and lose a fight against the goblins it will trigger a scene with one or both of them depending on who you've in your group.</li>
	<li>If you lose against orc brutes with Lyvia &amp; Tia in group it will result in a scene.</li>
</ol>
