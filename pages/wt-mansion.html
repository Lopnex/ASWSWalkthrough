				<div>Move up to the path where the river moves under the mansion to find the secret entry. Once there you need a torch to continue. This can be found in the MC's house. (Either visit the mayor and pay 20 gold or if you started Bianca's quest you can open the door with lockpicking after midnight).</div>

	<li>The torch is inside the MC's house on a barrel near the window.</li>
	<li>Once below the mayor's house you need to open the door via strength or lockpicking (don't bother with the right door, even if you lockpick it now it won't open).</li>
	<li>Before entering the mansion: Prevent to be detected by guards or the people in the house. If you completed Emily's quest you can choose to put on the bandit disguise you still got. This will prevent you from suffering consequences when being caught. But It will alarm the mansion. So after getting caught one day has to pass for everything to go back to normal. If you get caught undisguised your reputation in Arenfield will drop.</li>

				<div>Walk inside the library or office of the mayor to find a secret door at the bookshelf. You need at least 1 point in Perception to find it (Talents) There will be a notification that you notice fresh air. Then check the shelf to make a talent check. If you get close to the shelf and no notice pops up you have to click the shelf again to get another chance.</div>

	</li>
	<li>Once you find it, move to the basement. Down there you can find a key for the door in the bucket in the SE corner of the room. Now remove the bag in front of the door to make this shortcut available. There is also a letter on the bed you can read. This will add a picture of Yasmine to your inventory (can open it again under key items).</li>
	<li>Move up into Giron's office inside the bookshelf you can now also use the option to stay. If you are inside push enter or click on it to interact.</li>
	<li>In Giron's office read the letter on his desk to gain knowledge about the baron of Kirlic.</li>
	<li>Now you got everything unlocked to do Frisha's and Yasmine's content.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">After Lyvia lead the soldiers into the forest you can lockpick the front door at night to get quicker access to the mansion.</li>

<p>You can exchange the bottle in the servant's sleeping room with cum-wine (created with wine-bottle+cum vial) In the evening at midnight Julia will get +1C after she done this 5 times she will have sex with Joseph before going to bed (<span class="red">only if you did deny her the love option during Yasmine's dialogue</span>).</p>
