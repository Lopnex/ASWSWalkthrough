<p>The queen. Mother to Sophie.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p class="new-0-5-1-0">There are a few conditions before she arrives in Arenfield:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="new-0-5-1-0">Play through <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-frisha">Frisha's</span> story up to the point where the King arrives in Arenfield.</li>
			<li class="new-0-5-1-0">Play through <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-lyvia">Lyvia's</span> story up to the point where you have 5 mercenaries stationed in Arenfield.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">If both conditions are met she will arrive a few days later.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">Corruption: At any time after Helena arrived you can tamper with her wine. To do that enter the Mayor's kitchen and have a bottle of Cumwine with you. There is a spark that indicates where you have to go. If you do that early on Sophie will also get corrupted. If Helena reaches 5 corruption she will start masturbating in her room at 3am.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">After her arrival talk to general Lodric in the morning near the mayor's mansion.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">Helena leaves the mansion to visit people in Arenfield on Monday (John), Wednesday (Penny), Sunday (Church). All other days she is at Yasmine's living room every time between 12-4pm.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">Talk to Helena when she is outside the mansion twice. After that the MC plans to steal from her to put her guards in disgrace. To do that break into the guesthouse at the mansion at night (everyone should be asleep at 3am). Lockpick the doors and loot the chests in each room.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">The coming day talk to Helena again outside the mansion. You are now allowed to enter the garden.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">Wait until Helena returns to the garden at 5pm. Talk to her when she is sitting on the bench.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">In the evening visit her at dinner. You now have a choice to make: Allow Sophie to listen or send her back to her room. If you allow her this will have consequences on Eric winning the war.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">(Optional) should you have allied with Van you now can talk to Hekima and inform him about Sophie, he will then take her captive (unless you allowed her to listen, which will make this impossible).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">The next day visit the guesthouse in the morning between 6-12 (you must enter the door from the outside).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">Give Helena a day to recover, then talk to her on the bench in the afternoon (5pm).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">Visit her again at dinner, you have to repeat this 2 times. After the 2nd you have the choice to kiss her (for love route) or to not kiss her which then only allows the corruption route.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">The next day have dinner with her again, if you are on the love route she will invite you to her room. Otherwise if you didn't go for the love route and her C is 10+ you can visit her room at 3am and then choose to enter.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">This will complete the quest. Her room is now visible at all time and you can enter and interact with Helena at any time. In the evening she will invite you into her bed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="new-0-6-0-0">Winterhowl scene with <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-yasmine">Yasmine</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li class="new-0-6-0-0">
		To trigger this you must:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Have had sex with Yasmine in her bedroom (older saves might require doing this step again).</li>
			<li>Completed Helena's story up to the point where you had sex with her too.</li>
		</ol>
		Then during December (either in-game or in real life), the quest will start while you're in Arenfield.
	</li>
	<li class="new-0-6-0-0">
		Visit Yasmine to then gather a few things for her.
		<ul>
			<li>You can buy the wine from Thomas, or find it in his cellar or buy it cheap from Bjorn at the old boar inn).</li>
			<li>You also want to get dresses for the women from Verena, visit her and she will give you a price depending on your progress with her.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li class="new-0-6-0-0">Bring everything to Yasmine and then visit Helena at dinner to trigger the scene.</li>
	<li class="new-0-6-0-0">To fully play through it Helena requires 10C or she will call a stop to it in the middle before anything really escalates.</li>
</ol>
