	<li>After dealing with the orcs (one way or another) talk to her outside the chieftains hut.</li>
	<li>Depending on previous choices you will now have to talk to Dasan, Gurtak or just go off and find a way to get into Madrag Kaz.</li>
	<li>To get there leave the forest map near the orc camp at the east side (either right before the orc village or in the small passage to the right).</li>
	<li>On the next map travel to the far NE of the map. The MC will notice a path there right in the edge.</li>
	<li>Enter Madrag Kaz, your group members will leave you alone for this. You need to get to the very left side to listen in on the conversation. At night there are no patrolling orcs so you might want to wait until 8pm. Or if you have the sneak talent from Bianca's quest you can use it to easily get to the position.</li>
	<li>After listening return to Rumah.</li>
	<li>Talk to Raaisha outside the chieftains tent for a reward.</li>
	<li>The next time you have Tia in group when you talk to Raaisha you will see an option for Tia to join in. This will only work if Tia has C15+.</li>
	<li>Should you be on the chieftain route you can trigger both scenes also inside by talking to Raaisha.</li>
	<li>In the evening you can now sit by the fire. You can either do this with Tia or sit alone. If Tia/Ayita are not occupied with other actions they will dance for you at the fire. Should Raaisha be near too she will come over and ask to join you.</li>
	<li>The next step is to build a cell where you can keep Umah prisoner in. Depending on your route you will now either have to talk to Dasan or visit the chieftains tent and use the (new) tribe management screen.</li>
	<li>Use it to clear the area to the north of Rumah by sending men there. Make sure they have enough food and if on the chieftain route either give them wine or women to speed up the process. If one of them gets hurt you can click on the wounded native icon to mend his wounds.<br>
	<span class="red">Should you be on the Dasan route and you didn't lose to him you can now offer Tia to him in exchange for taking the tribes resources. To do that click on the resources and then after trying to take them leave the management screen. Should Tia be in group at that moment she will be angry for the rest of the day.</span></li>
	<li>After the area is cleared and you inspected it use the management screen again to build a cage.</li>
	<li>When it is done talk to Raaisha again.</li>
	<li>The next step is to visit the orc camp. If you're on the Dasan route make sure one of the women is send there.</li>
	<li>Depending on previous choices you will now either have to poison the orcs, scare/fight the remaining orcs, talk to Gurtak to send them away.</li>
	<li>Now talk to Maui and take her to Rumah. This will start a new quest where you have to visit Gwen. If you already became her apprentice and played through her storyline she will tell you about the orcs. This will open up a new option in the future of Umah's story.</li>
	<li>Visit the tribe management screen again, recall all men and if one of them is wounded heal him. Then send them to the orc camp and prepare the ambush.</li>
	<li>Make sure you're rested and maybe save before the next step. Enter the Orc camp from the west over the tree which is now put over the river. Interact with the star. If you made a deal with Gurtak before you can now choose to kill him or give up on the revenge. If you kill him this will make sending women to the camp unavailable.</li>
	<li>After the event enter Madrag Kaz (be rested and save) over the main entrance. The orcs will let you pass this time.</li>
	<li>Return to Rumah and talk to Raaisha. This will enable a new scene which is available inside the chieftains hut too.</li>
