	<li class="new-0-5-6-0">You can now enter the living room of the smithy and talk to Melissa.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-6-0">The next day at 6pm check the alley behind the smithy where Melissa will talk to 2 guys. You now have the choice to interfere of stay out (staying out will cause the NTR route to start.</li>

Find the location on the map in the open world (you can press M to open the map, there is an extra button to show the current treasure) - should you have problems finding it visit Melissa the next day, she will give you a hint where to look.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-6-0">After you found the chest return to her, this will lead to you having to look for another 3 parts of a map that will lead to the chalice.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-6-0">After finding all 4 parts you will be tasked to find the entrance to the sanctuary. This is located to the south of Arenfield at the cliffs (You can see small rock splinters left and right at the wall. Use a pickaxe to open the entrance.</li>

But returning it will also have it's consequences. By taking it with you, you also have the option to use it (drink from it, raises corruption and fills lust to 100) this will lead the MC on a dark path which will have more consequences in terms of personality in the future.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-6-0">Back at the smithy you report to Melissa and then depending on the previous choice have an option on how to deal with the thugs. If you don't have the chalice (or have drunken from it) you can: fight them, ignore them and let Melissa keep them happy or should you have 2+ guards at Arenfield they will scare them away.</li>
