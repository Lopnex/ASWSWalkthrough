<p class="new-0-5-5-0">High priestess of Parakis. Mother of <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-bridget">Bridget</span>. Unlocked as part of <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-monastery">The Monastery</span>.</p>
<ol>
	<li class="new-0-5-5-0">After Bridget asks you to find her diary sneak into her room and inspect her bed, you may then try to reach under her pillow, for that you will have to pass a dexterity check (you can fail on purpose by choosing the option to do it quickly).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-5-0">
		<p>Depending on if you succeed doing this or not there are different outcomes for Agatha.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You succeed and then blackmail her (Agatha submission route).</li>
			<li>You succeed and then ask for money (no more content with Agatha).</li>
			<li>You succeed and then return the book without money (love route).</li>
			<li>You fail and submit to her (Agatha dominance route).</li>
			<li>You fail but then don't submit (means Bridget will marry Jorge) - (love route).</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-5-0">Either route will have different dialogue and slightly different animations, corrupting her is also possible and at 5C+ she will start masturbating at midnight. (so best make a save before and then go with the route you prefer).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-5-0">Should you later on decide to accuse Adson (only possible if you got her diary and also found the letter for Matthias in your room) she will be furious, but if you blackmail her she will still continue to be your servant.</li>
