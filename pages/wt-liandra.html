<p>Future baroness of Kirlic.</p>
<ol>
	<li>After completing <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-frisha">Frisha's</span> quest up to the point where you either freed her from Dave or they now regularly meet to fuck sneak into the mayor's study again and &#34;hide and listen&#34; inside the bookcase. The baron will then tell Dave that Liandra is going to arrive soon in Arenfield. If Frisha is still in a relationship with Dave, Giron will tell him that she can no longer come for dinner.</li>
	<li>3 days later a carriage will arrive in Arenfield, visit Giron's study again and listen in while he talks to the coachman (same way as before).</li>
	<li>Leave the house and inspect the carriage near the inn.</li>
	<li>Visit Giron, use the front door this time. Giron is desperate and willing to pay you with 50 gold. But instead of taking that gold you can also ask to marry Julia (only if you already got to know her) Depending on your former deeds (If you already helped the baron with the mine) he will agree to hat, if you didn't already help him he will give you the option to further prove your worth to him before you then get to marry her.</li>
	<li>Leave Arenfield to the east and follow the road until you get to the bridge where Oliver is standing. Talk to him about the carriage.</li>
	<li>Inspect the indicated position next to the bridge. You will have to complete a hunting check to continue (will require energy so come rested).</li>
	<li>Walk to the north near the ruin you will find the next stop, next check.</li>
	<li>Walk to the west, near the tree at the river you will find the 3rd spot, next check.</li>
	<li>Leave the map to the north and enter the eastern Darkwood.</li>
	<li>Near the tree stump you will find the next marker which points to the east.</li>
	<li>Here there are no more tracks, but if you inspect the vines near the mountain you will find a hidden cave.</li>
	<li>There are brigands in the mine (level 20+) so you better bring Tia/Lyvia with you. Also if you use the sneak talent from Bianca you can attack the brigands from behind. If they don't see you coming they won't get alerted and the fights will be a lot easier.</li>
	<li>Kill all brigands in the cave (one of them is in the North east) then talk to Liandra and free her. Her clothes are in the chest in the same room.</li>
	<li>After you've given them to her you have to make a decision. (might be a good moment to save) Talk to her again and the MC will have a small monologue.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are now 2 options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Don't bring her to the Baron:</strong><br>
		If you already taken over the bandit camp you can bring her there. After that talk to the Baron, he won't be happy that you couldn't find Liandra and the quest will fail. If you asked to marry Julia Giron will tell you that you have to earn her (there will be a way to do so in the future) This will enable a route to have fun with Liandra at your camp and in the future to return her to Kirlic.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You can now report to Giron that Liandra is lost to him. He won't be happy, but it's not the end of the world.</li>
			<li>Back at the camp talk to Liandra at the fire. You will tell her that she can take a bath in the cave. (you can now spy on her, just be careful to not stay too long).</li>
			<li>A new quest should start (if it doesn't don't worry you can still do the next steps) You now have to find soap for her in Arenfield. You can either steal it from the inn or the baron's kitchen. (a white square on the ground near the wash bucket) - If you steal it from the inn there will be a scene with Claire and Thomas in the future, but it's currently just planned and not implemented.</li>
			<li>Talk to her at the fire, she will ask for a book. Sneak into the baron's library and go to the shelfs in the upper left of the room to find a book. Then talk to her at the fire again.</li>
			<li>She will read the book in the evening in her tent. That will raise her corruption to 1. She will now masturbate every 2 days in her tent in the evening.</li>
			<li>The next step is to organize a party to lift everyones spirit.</li>
			<li>You must have completed Imawyn's story up to the point where you can have sex with her at the camp. Talk to her at the fire about the party and she will agree to play should you bring her a violin.</li>
			<li>You can buy one at Lucius shop (in the middle of the room near the crates), it will cost you 5 gold.</li>
			<li>Return it to Imawyn, she will tell you that she can't play without new strings. In Arenfield either wait for Ophilia to be in town with her horse, then wait until she's not near it and interact with it OR should you already have bought it from her visit the barn and cut a bit from the mane there. Return it to Imawyn at the fire.</li>
			<li>Find 2 dresses for Liandra &amp; Lyvia in the baron's mansion on the 2nd floor. One is in the wardrobe down right and the other top right in the baron's bedroom. Bring them to the women when they are both at the camp.</li>
			<li>You now need 3 bottles of wine (can be bought from Thomas at the inn) place them near the fire.</li>
			<li>Now everything is prepared and when Lyvia is near the fire you can start the celebration.</li>
			<li>When the others go to their tents you can ask Liandra for another dance. (only if her affection is at 6+).</li>
			<li>You have to repeat the party, then when her affection is at 10+ you can kiss her (if it's lower don't do it to get an extra affection point).</li>
			<li>The next day talk to her at the fire. You can now have fun with her in the evening at her tent or when you start another party. She will also no longer be mad if you spy on her in the cave.</li>
			<li>Should you leave her unfucked for 2 days she will masturbate in the evening in her tent.</li>
			<li class="new-0-5-7-0">You can trigger her Breast expansion at the camp by letting Tia dance infront of her during the feast and by touching Lyvia's ass when dancing with her alone. After she watched you a few times she will ask you if you prefer bigger tits. If you admit that it will open up a quest to get the potion from Giron's study (hide and listen, then find the bottle on top of the cabinet).</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Return her to Giron:</strong><br>
		You get the option to ask <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-john">John</span> for a chastity belt. If you completed his quest up to the point where the mine is working again he will agree to make it. You have to give him 3 iron bars. If his quest is already completed and there are 3 bars in his smithy he will use these instead. - Liandra can now be convinced to wear the belt, that will diable all future NTR content with Dave and add some scene where the MC can play with her when she's desperate to get off. If you want NTR with Dave don't let her wear the belt.<br>
		The next choice is to warn her about Giron's medicine. Yasmine's body has been transformed to her current state. If you warn her Liandra will stay the way she is.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>After bringing her to the Baron sneak into his study and listen to the conversation between him and Dave.</li>
			<li>A new quest should pop up, now visit Liandra in her room (careful with the guard (wait until he sleeps), If you didn't break into the room before you need to learn how to <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-bianca">lockpick</span> first).</li>
			<li>During the conversation Yasmine will visit the room, Liandra now has a new dress.</li>
			<li>Sneak into the dining room of the mansion and wait for dinner.</li>
			<li>After dinner when Liandra is in Dave's room listen in (has to be on a day where Frisha isn't visiting).</li>
			<li>Visit her in her room afterwards. Depending on your previous choices she will now undergo drastic changes or not.</li>
			<li>Now you have the choice to corrupt her by placing cumwine in Dave's room. (if you didn't exchange it when Frisha was there you don't have to do that). The other option to just save her by talking to the baron of Kirlic isn't in the game yet.</li>
			<li>You can now watch her when she visits Dave and spy on her in her room. Make sure she notices you when you spy on her. She will get used to it and eventually she wants more (at 3+ Corruption).</li>
			<li>If you do it right you can have sex with her before Dave does. If you locked her into chastity you don't have to fear about Dave. Just make sure she has seen you when she masturbates. Then walk in on her when ever she is sitting in her room.</li>
