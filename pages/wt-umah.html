<p>Orc chieftain's daughter.</p>
<ol>
	<li>To get to her content complete <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-raaisha">Raaisha's</span> quest up to step 21.</li>
	<li>Talk to Umah in her cage, then challenge her to a duel and win.</li>
	<li>Talk to her again the next day, you now need to complete the quest from Maui (visit Gwen and ask her about Maui first, for that to work you must first have helped Gwen to get her power back) - If both is done the MC will want to visit the Church in Arenfield.</li>
	<li>Talk to sister Natasha and ask about the goddess Athia.</li>
	<li>Interact with the fountain (you need an empty vial from the shop), take 2 vials full of the water (you need the 2nd eventually later). If the water isn't tainted already (see Natasha's quest) use the masturbate skill (skillbook, MC) and cum inside the holy water.</li>
	<li>Return to Rumah and talk to Umah, she won't drink the water.</li>
	<li>For the next step to work <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-nyra">Nyra</span> must be your wanita already. - Talk to her when she is cooking in the evening, she will agree to help you.</li>
	<li>Hide near the cage (marked by a star on the east side near the tree).</li>
	<li>Talk to Umah and either promise her to let her go or not (if you don't keep your promise she will lose affection).</li>
	<li>The next day depending on route (Dasan or Chieftain) you can either decide to let her out or keep her locked up.</li>
	<li>The next day talk to her again. If on Dasan's route you now have to talk to Dasan, otherwise you have a choice between option 1 &amp; 2 (on Dasan's route he will make that choice for route 2).</li>
	<li>Route 1 keep her as she is, Route 2 give her the 2nd potion.</li>
	<li>If on route 2 you now have to get a dress for her. Visit Frisha and buy one from her for 10 gold.</li>
	<li>Talk to Umah again she will now talk to Maui about her parents, leave her alone for the day then return.</li>
	<li>For the next step you want to be rested and maybe also bring Tia with you. Depending on your character strength this is going to be a tough fight. So maybe save before visiting Madrag Kaz with Umah.</li>
	<li>Back home you now have to build a tent for Umah. Gather the needed materials (rope at the shop) then build it. After that you have to decide if you want any sexual content with Umah (If you chose no there won't be anything going on further. The quest just ends here).</li>
	<li class="red">If you are on the Dasan route he will now show up. From now on Umah visits him every day at 12pm. You can watch by interacting with the entrance of the Chieftains tent. After the 10th day Dasan will take her virginity, so if you want to take it you have to hurry.</li>
	<li>Talk to her again the next day, the MC will give her a tour around the village. And this now opens up to go on a date with Umah.</li>
	<li>For that you need a blanket first. Go into the carpenter's house and steal cloth from Verena's workshop (the cloth is right next to her loom), you should also bring wine/cumwine and something to eat. 20. Now ask Umah on a date. Give her something to drink and eat to raise her affection/corruption.</li>
	<li>At 12 affection Umah will be willing to accept your attempts.</li>
	<li>The next day date her again, she will ask you to visit her tent which then concludes the quest.</li>
	<li>You can now go out with her again or directly have sex in her tent.</li>
