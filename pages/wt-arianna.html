<p>Lives with her mother <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-verena">Verena</span>, father Roderic, and older brother Rick.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Meet her at the Darkwood entrance after you completed the intro.</li>
	<li>You can also meet her at the ruins.</li>
	<li>7 days after the first meeting with her outside of Arenfield you can meet her again at the same spot and she will ask you to visit her near the ruins.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Visit her and play hide and seek with her 2 times (she will hide at random locations near the ruins and some might be harder to spot then others) If you can't find her you can skip a day ahead and she will pick a new spot. The location is always random and some of her hiding places are hard to see (some examples in the image below).</p>

	<li>The 3rd time a story event will happen.</li>
	<li>You must have completed <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-corven">Corven's</span> story up to after the hare paw quest.</li>
	<li>Talk to Corven at his camp near the ruins (before 6pm).</li>
	<li>Ask him how to fight the werewolf. Now visit the smithy. You must have completed the part on how to forge.</li>
	<li>Use the furnace to make a silver bar from coins.</li>
	<li>Use the anvil and make silver arrows.</li>
	<li>Talk to Corven at his camp about your next steps.</li>
	<li>Visit Corven again at his camp, after that repair the bridge near the old chapel with 4 wood logs.</li>
	<li>Enter the chapel and read the book at the top right (must have learned how to read).</li>
	<li>After reading the page you have to enter a number. It's the difference between the red printed number on the bookmark and the left page.<br>
	1245 - 358 = 887</li>
	<li>
		<p>Inside the hideout try to not get caught by the guards (hide between barrels).</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If you got into a fight and lost: You're now in a cell. But there is a hole in the ground at the top of the cell that you can use to flee.</li>
			<li>In the tunnels you can find a pickaxe.</li>
			<li>
				<p>With the pickaxe you can break the walls at the marked positions.</p>
				<img src="/ASWSWalkthrough/images/arianna2.jpg">
			</li>
			<li>Careful, in the tunnels are spiders, if you lose to them it's game over. If you're low on hp, rest in the cell.</li>
			<li>In the room below the prison you can find a chest with all the item's they stole from you.</li>
			<li>In the tunnels to the south you can also find a new bow.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Make your way to the down right corner where the cells are. And listen to the conversation.</li>
	<li>Free Arianna (Either lockpick the door or fight the guard to get the key).</li>
	<li>Escape with Arianna to the exit. If you walk the main corridor you will run into the werewolf and some guards. This is now your chance to kill the werewolf. Use either the silver arrows (item) or if you have the silver dagger use the skill blood poison on the werewolf to remove his thick skin. (killing him will disable some future scenes), If you don't want to fight them just use the spider tunnels (the walls can also be broken with a pickaxe from the outside).</li>
	<li>There is also another image if you manage to get past him and listen in on the cultists at the top right sanctum while Arianna is in group.</li>
	<li>Outside the hideout a cutscene will play. Arianna has been poisoned with a dreadful liquid that will turn her into a beast.</li>
	<li>For the next step you must have completed <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-lucius">Lucius</span> quest and have visited his shop again a few days later to buy the strong anesthetic.</li>
		<li>
			<p>Talk to Arianna near the ruins again.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If you kiss her you've started the love route with her</li>
				<li>If you insist that she drinks the potion she will ask you to return to her in 7 days to give her another one (you can then choose to have sex with her instead).<br>
				If NTR is enabled Arianna will also look for another way to find relief in the meantime and will visit Corven's tent. You can watch them in the afternoon at 4pm.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	<li>After having sex with her play another round of hide and seek with her. This will enable another animation for her.</li>
	<li>(Optional) If you completed her former content playing hide and seek with Arianna can result in her getting stuck in a treetrunk (if you didn't have sex with her for 3 days the chance is 100%) Get her out of there once, the next time it happens this will result in a new scene. (NTR: after the second time you have the choice to leave her inside the trunk).</li>
	<li>After unlocking both scenes by playing hide and seek leave Arianna and wait for 3 days, then talk to her again. She will tell you that she is under house arrest. (starts a new quest).</li>
	<li>Sneak into her parents house (Carpenter's house) and enter her room upstairs without getting seen. (If you learned how to <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-bianca">lockpick</span> you can do that at any time).</li>
	<li>Talk to her at night (10pm), after the scene go downstairs, enter the workshop, enter Roderic's study upstairs and search the cabinet and all shelf's until the MC has seen enough.</li>
	<li>Take a look at what day it is (for example Monday). Wait for the next day (Tuesday) and search the cabinet inside Roderic's study again.</li>
	<li>At midnight wait downstairs on a Tuesday,Thursday or Sunday. Don't fast forward and look where Roderic is going.</li>
	<li>Inspect the cabinet, you need to pass a perception check. After completing it you can climb down. You should be well equipped for what comes next and better use the save option because if you fail you won't get out alive.</li>
	<li>Confront Roderic when he's in his hideout, you want to use a silver weapon to remove his immunity buff (needs silver dagger or arrows) on him to win the fight.</li>
	<li>The next night talk to Arianna. She will now leave the house again every two days. The house arrest is now in part ended and the quest completed.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">Arianna visits Rumah: After her house arrest is lifted leave Arenfield through the northern exit (has to be on a day where Arianna is in the forest). When you try to leave towards the bridge she will show up.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">Visit Rumah to find Arianna has been spotted by scouts, this will trigger an interaction either with the MC or Dasan depending on route. You can now send Arianna away (she will never return to Rumah) or make her your wanita.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-3-0">This now opens up interaction with her when ever she visits Rumah<br>
	<span class="red">NTR: if on Dasan's route he will try to get into her pants. Leave them alone in Rumah for a few days then visit Rumah before noon to catch them inflagranti.</span></li>
