<ol>
	<li>After completing the 3rd Puzzle of Gwen's storyline talk to her in the evening (8pm+) while she's sitting on her bed.</li>
	<li>Do that every day (there are decisions to be made while doing it) until she tells you to come and visit her later.</li>
	<li>When she's sleeping uncover her to start the next conversation.</li>
	<li>After you had sex with her 3 times in her bed her story progresses.</li>
	<li>Afterwards you can trigger the scene again by talking to Gwen at the cauldron.</li>
	<li>In case NTR is on and you have chosen the futa route with Sabrina, should Gwen's corruption fall below 10 (it falls every day by 2) Gwen will have sex with Sabrina at 12pm.</li>
	<li>After the events with Gwen that lead to the transformation of Athia into a human body talk to Sabrina. After that visit her again at night in her bed. If she reaches 5 corruption you will see some changes in her dialogue and during the scene when she is standing in the back when Gwen has sex with you.</li>
