<p><span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-bianca">Bianca's</span> &#34;master&#34;.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Complete Bianca's story up to the part of meeting her.</li>
	<li>To continue her quest talk to Bianca in her room to learn how to sneak.</li>
	<li>Go to the south of Arenfield and enter the Southern road, from there you can get into the mine.</li>
	<li>Be careful to not let the goblins see you! If they do it will trigger an attack of multiple goblins and the original mob will still be on the map.</li>
	<li>To eliminiate the goblins attack them from behind.</li>
	<li>In the middle of the mine there is a camp with a chest behind a cart, you can use your sneak skill to get to the chest without being seen. (If they see you you better have Lyvia &amp; Tia in group to kill the whole camp).</li>
	<li>In total there are 3 camps inside the mine, If you clear them all the remaining goblins won't get any help if they call for it.</li>
	<li>After you claimed the stone from the chest return to Gavina and talk to her.</li>
	<li>Now you can talk to her again and then escort her through the mine to the northern area where the entrance to the dwarven enclave is. Goblins will spawn along the way. So be prepared to enter stealth mode.<br>
	<span class="red">Careful:</span> In case you don't want NTR content you might want to be prepared for what comes next. (you should either complete Gwen's quest up to the point where you learn to cast Soulsteal or Have a silver arrow with you from Arianna's quest).</li>
	<li>Inside you now have 3 options. Option 1 &amp; 2 will require the quest progress I just mentioned. Option 3 will direct you to Gwen. You now have 7 days to rescue Bianca &amp; Gavina. If you fail you either lose (if NTR is off) or they will addapt to their situation. You can always try to rescue them even without the spell with Lyvia &amp; Tia in group for some extra content for them.</li>
	<li>Back at home The quest is complete and it will continue with Gavina's next update!</li>
	<li>However now that Gavina was at her hometown her inner fire has become active again. If you sleep in her bed and she is there aswell she will wake up. If you already started a love relationship with Bianca this will put her at an inner conflict which you can solve by talking to her.</li>
	<li>If her affection is at 13+ she will await you inside her room in the morning (she goes to bed at 9am).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-1">After you had sex with her 5 times she will ask you to forge a special plug for her to calm her desire. For that she gives you a gemstone.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-1">To forge the plug you must have learned forging from John and you'll also need 2 whetstones (you can get those from mining iron/copper/thin, they can also be used to improve weapons shouldn't you've noticed).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-1">In the Smithy forge the plug, then talk to Gavina in the livingroom.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-1">Visit Gavina in the morning when she's in bed waiting for you (requires 13+ affection).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-1">If you have lubricant from Tia's anal quest you can use it to speed up the process. Should Gavina have been fucked by goblins at least 10 times the process will also be a lot quicker.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-1">After the plug went in successful you can now also corrupt her by asking for a blowjob.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-1">When having sex you can now switch to anal if Gavina either had 10 times sex with goblins or should you have progressed the training with the plug a little (needs to be repeated) - She will keep the plug inside her ass should you not take it out. Currently that won't increase the training with it so you should always take it out (will probably be changed in 0.5.7.2+) before cumming (there is an option for that).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-1">On higher corruption Gavina has slightly different dialog during sex and after having anal sex 10 times she will start to enjoy it.</li>
	<li class="new-0-6-0-0">After completing the first step of the quest around the goblins (after you entered the deep mine) Gavina will wait at home with a small surprise for you.</li>
