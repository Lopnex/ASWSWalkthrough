<p>Seamstress. Lives with her mother <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-emily">Emily</span> and younger sister <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-mira">Mira</span>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>When talking to her you can give her a present once per day. (necklace, ring, brooch) to raise her affection for you. These can be bought at the shop, dropped by enemies, found in coin pouches, found in the world with perception.</li>	<li>If you asked her to make a dress for you (Kate, Umah or Athia) this will trigger that she talks to Grant in front of the inn when he is in town.</li>
	<li>Visit her in her room, you can now decide to give her the money (if so you can make her pay for it with her body) or deny her the help.
		<ol type="A">
			<li>If you help her and want something for it: There is now the option to take her virginity at this point. To do that you have to wait until she has an orgasm, then click continue this will then lead to a scene where the MC takes her virginity. At the end you can decide not to come. If you do that this gives you the option to not give Frisha the money after all... This will then lead to B (NTR with Grant). If you give her the money she won't have anything going with Grant.</li>
			<li>If you deny her the help she will have another talk with Grant. You can watch them inside Grant's room in the afternoon upstairs. Frisha will now always go there when Grant is in town. Dialogue changes depending on Frisha still being with Dave/MC. (If she is in a relationship with the MC she will need at least C10+ or she won't cheat on the MC).</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If you fuck Emily (and Emily has another orgasm during that sex) Frisha will notice and watch you, this will alter her dialogue and if you talk to her at 11A she will give you a some attention.</li>
	<li>Watch her talk to Dave on a Saturday or Wednesday.</li>
	<li>You can crash into her when she's walking over but this will only make her return home and does not progress the quest.</li>
	<li>Infiltrate the <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-mansion">mayor's mansion</span>.</li>
	<li>On a Wednesday or Saturday walk inside the dining room before 6pm, there is a star symbol near the shelf where you can hide until dinner.</li>
	<li>After dinner wait until Frisha and Dave are in his room and listen to their conversation.</li>
	<li>The next day hide inside the bookshelf in Giron's office (move there from another floor and then inside use 'Hide and listen') do this at noon after Giron is in his office to see a conversation between him and Dave.</li>
</ol>
<p class="red">This quest will only continue if you completed <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-lucius">Lucius' quest</span>!</p>
<ol start="11">
	<li>Dave will try to corrupt Frisha, you can prevent this by replacing the wine bottle in his room with a normal one or leave it and her corruption will rise.</li>
	<li>The next time Frisha visits Dave listen again on them.</li>
	<li>The next day spy on Dave &amp; Giron again. If you didn't sell potion to Lucius Giron has nothing to give to Dave (You can of course exchange the bottle afterwards to either raise her corruption or prevent it).</li>
	<li>Spy on Frisha and Dave again. Dave will try to kiss Frisha and you can prevent this.</li>
	<li>Enter Arenfield in between 8:00-16:00 to see a cutscene.</li>
	<li>Spy on Dave &amp; Giron again (like step 8.).</li>
	<li>
		<p>Spy on Frisha &amp; Dave at the next date and either prevent the events or let it happen (NTR).</p>

				<li>The next time Frisha talk's to Dave in the morning make sure he won't try that again.</li>

				<li>Walk in on her when she's preparing for bed to start a sexual relationship with her (need to be A16+).</li>

If you have the lubricant from Tia's questline this will make things easier. - If you didn't go the loveroute you have to further increase her corruption up to 15, then the same option to have anal will show.</li>
				<li>After having successfully having anal with Frisha sleep in her bed (Has to be triggered from the dialogue when Frisha isn't masturbating).</li>
