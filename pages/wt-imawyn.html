<p>Bandit leader.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Complete <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-emily">Emily's</span> quest up to 5.</li>
	<li>7 days after the kidnapping sleep in the storeroom at Emily's house again and don't prevent Emily getting kidnapped.</li>
	<li>Talk to Lyvia (at the bridge in Arenfield in the afternoon). You will get a bandit disguise.</li>
	<li>Talk to Thomas (Inn) and buy a bottle of wine, talk to Lucius (shop) and buy (normal) Anesthetic (to get this see 6. Lucius).</li>
	<li>To mix Anesthetic with the wine you need the recipe from Lucius quest (control your lust). Open the craft menu &#34;C&#34; or via the menu (esc).</li>
	<li>Visit the camp. If Emily is still captured, rescue her first. At the Rock in the south you can put on the bandit disguise during the evening (If the camp is alarmed or during the day the disguise won't work).</li>
	<li>Talk to each bandit and give them something from your sleeping wine. After all are asleep enter Imawyn's tent. (after doing this once there is a spot near the campfire where you can offer a drink for everyone, if you have sleep-wine in your inventory) <span class="new-0-5-7-0">- You can also just kill them all. If you have Tia with you this might be easier.</span></li>
	<li>(At this point you should have full Life/Energy, new armor from Lucius and sharpened dagger from John, learned defensive strike from Lyvia) Confront her. To win, use defensive strike every 3 turns starting with the 1. It will still be a tough fight. Should you lose she will take your keystone and instantly capture Emily again. (To get a new stone kill the bandit in the forest).</li>
	<li>After you defeat her, choose what to do with her. You can now start to corrupt her or turn her in to the militia (last will be continued in the future).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-0">The 3rd time you face her she will bring 2 additional bandits with her. Be prepared for that. Should you lose then you can also bring Tia with you into the battle for this one time.</li>
	<li>If you choose to have fun with her you have to compete with her again the same way you did before. At some point she gives up fighting you and surrenders to your judgment.</li>
	<li>If you have too long fun with her Lyvia will take care of Imawyn herself. This will change some of her dialogue and you will fail the quest.</li>
	<li>After you captured or Lyvia captured her you can talk to her in her cell. Depending on her corruption and if you captured her or not her dialogue will differ.</li>
	<li>After each interaction wait a day before you talk to her again. She will ask you for some entertainment. You can raise her corruption with cumwine, or just raise her affection with normal wine. Giving her only wine while keeping her corruption low will lead to her love route, this however will let you miss the scenes with her inside the cell (BJ &amp; sex).</li>
	<li>See <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-lyvia">Lyvia's</span> story to progress further.</li>
	<li>After you completed Lyvia's story up to the part where she is recruitable talk to Imawyn in her cell. If her corruption is &gt; 10 or if her affection &gt; 5 she will be willing to join you at the camp.</li>
	<li>Talk to her inside the leaders tent during the evening. Depending on Affection/corruption this will either trigger dialogue that will lead to her love route or will continue her corruption route.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-0">If her corruption is &gt; 10 and you leave Imawyn be for over a week she will be waiting for you inside the tent. This way you can replay the original scene with her before you imprisoned her.</li>
	<li>If you invite Tia to stay with you in the leaders tent after she has become your wanita she will ask for sex.<br>
	Should you also have increased her corruption to 5+ she will wake up Imawyn. If Imawyn herself has C10+ she will join in. This scene can be further expanded if you had anal with Tia 5+ times.<br>
	By changing position between anal/vaginal you will further increase Imawyn's own anal training. Then the next time you have sex with both of them Imawyn will also try out anal.</li>
	<li>After you had anal with Imawyn at least once she will also be willing to do it when Tia isn't around in the afternoon.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Corruption:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Every time you cum in her mouth will raise it. Do this after you had sex with her to speed up the process. At 10C enter her tent.. From now onward you won't need to put the bandits to sleep anymore.</li>
	<li>At 10C if you lose to the guard guarding Emily you will get a small bonus scene.</li>
