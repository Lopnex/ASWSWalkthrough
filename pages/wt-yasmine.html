<p>Baron Giron's wife.</p>
<ol>
	<li>After reading the letter in the mansion (see <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-mansion">mansion</span> 9.) talk to her when she's sitting in the living room. (make sure to do this without being disguised).</li>
	<li>Choose knowledge or if Intelligence &gt; 3 choose int. to introduce yourself to her. Alternative: If you only talk to her after asking to marry Julia you will introduce yourself differently which will also change the the rest of the dialogue.</li>
	<li>You can now talk to her every day to raise her affection for you. Start with kissing her hand until A4, Then start kissing her Neck until A7, then kiss her for A8.</li>
	<li>At 10pm she will move to her room. Try to enter (house has to be not alarmed) after she's in there and watch her then choose &#34;enter the room&#34;.</li>
	<li>The next time you do this you can choose to switch positions until it's past midnight and Giron enters the room. If Yasmine's C>5, she will ask you to continue after her husband fell asleep. (if NTR is enabled) should you decide to leave her then she will have sex with Giron instead after you left the room.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-0">After you had sex with her once you can also wake her up at night when she's already sleeping, if Giron is next to her you should be careful however. He might wake up to then fuck Yasmine himself (if you switch positions too often).</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-2-0">After you rescued her (see Lyvia's quest) there are 2 new animations available for her if you visit her at night.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-0">After her rescue and Liandra is at the Mansion or the camp you can trigger a threesome scene with the two.
		<ul>
			<li>On Liandra's baron route you have to talk to Liandra inside her room in the morning. Yasmine will come again for a visit, Liandra will then have to see the Baron. If she is unprotected and boosted up then Giron will take adventage of her. She will be angry with you for a few days so give her time to cool of. Afterwards have sex with her again during the day. Yasmine will come and spy on you to then join in.</li>
			<li>If Liandra is at camp: Talk to Yasmine in the livingroom and tell her about Liandra being save (only possible after the Raven quest). She will want to see her, so come there again in the evening the next day to then bring her to your camp.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Corruption:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>After you've talked to her during the day you can masturbate into the teapot in the kitchen. Then during the evening watch while she drinks the tea to raise her corruption.</li>
	<li>At C3+ She will start masturbating in her room at 10pm.</li>
	<li>At C6+ there is a new scene with her in the morning/evening.</li>
	<li>Talk to Julia in the kitchen so she is added to your relations.</li>
	<li>Talk to Yasmine when she's in the livingroom (7am - without Julia, 8pm - with Julia).</li>
	<li>When she asks you if you will come and visit her later on you can now choose &#34;right now&#34;.</li>
	<li>If Julia is in the room (8pm) she will now watch you closely if not the dialogue will be ofc without her presence.</li>
	<li>If Julia watched you you can talk to her when she's in the kitchen the next day.</li>
	<li>You can now either choose to give her hope or don't do it (If you don't then there is no more content with her).</li>
	<li>Now talk to Yasmine again at (8pm) and continue afterwards.</li>
</ol>
<h3>NTR:</h3>
