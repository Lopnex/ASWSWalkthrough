<p>Maid in the <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-mansion">mayor's mansion</span>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p class="new-0-5-1-0">There are 2 routes which you can go for Julia:</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li class="new-0-5-1-0">By having sex with <span class="wt-link" data-target="wt-yasmine">Yasmine</span> and corrupting Julia by licking up the cum you can also corrupt her by exchanging the wine in the servants room.</li>
			<li class="new-0-5-1-0">Chat with her and then when the story progresses ask Giron for her hand.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-7-0">If you fuck Yasmine in front of her this will trigger another dialogue with her in the kitchen (should you be on loveroute with her), after that she will join in the next time this happens. Doing so will take her virginity if you didn't go on a date and had sex with her that way.</li>
	<li>If you already told Julia that you aren't interested but then ask her father to marry her you will go back to the love route with her.</li>
	<li class="new-0-5-1-0">On both routes you now have the option to ask her out on a date. In case you already have renovated your house and have comissioned a larger bed you will invite Julia into your room. If her affection is 10+ she will have sex with the MC (if the first time MC will take her virginity) if you invite her a second time you get access to another animation &amp; she will stay over night.</li>
	<li>Talk to her again and ask her for a quickie in the kitchen (available also if on love route).</li>
	<li>(NTR) If you now tell her that she should improve she will think about doing just that with the help of the buttler. If she has C5+ she will have sex with him at midnight. If you then stumble in and wait until they see you (undisguised) you will be put under arrest, but it will allow you also new dialogue with Julia in the kitchen. You can now continue this road. The next time you stumble in on them the butler will tell you that he will train her further for you.</li>
	<li>Depending on if you chose the NTR route (6.) you will have to either complete step 3 or 4 before this can happen: If you completed John's quest up to the point where Julia brought tea to the mayor while you were visiting him (The step where you can send men to the mine) she will tell you that her father wants to see her.</li>
	<li>Use the bookcase in Giron's study and &#34;hide and listen&#34; while he is in there. Julia will now enter and they will have a small conversation.</li>
	<li>Talk to Julia in the kitchen. This will now also change the scene with her at the piano with Yasmine.</li>
